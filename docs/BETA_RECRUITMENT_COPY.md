**Looking for 5-10 Ninja Selling agents to beta test my new AI-powered relationship tool**

I've been building something I'm really excited about: an AI assistant specifically designed for Ninja Selling practitioners.

**What it does:**
- Voice AI you can talk to about your relationships and business
- Scans your Gmail to find contacts you've lost touch with
- Drafts personalized outreach messages based on your FORD notes
- Command shortcuts for comparing listings, drafting texts, and more

**What I need:**
- 5-10 agents willing to explore and give honest feedback
- Someone who uses Gmail and wants to level up their relationship tracking
- Bonus if you're Ninja Selling certified (but not required)

**What you get:**
- Free access during beta
- Direct input on features before launch
- Early adopter pricing when we go live

CRM integration (Follow Up Boss, Cloze, Lofty) is on the roadmap for February - for now you can import contacts via CSV or add manually.

Comment "I'M IN" or DM me if interested. Spots are limited!

Hey Ninjas! 

I'm a fellow Ninja Selling practitioner and I've been building an AI tool to help with our daily workflows. Think of it as an AI Chief of Staff that actually *does* work for you, not just shows you data.

**Currently working:**
- Voice conversation with AI (ask questions, get suggestions)
- Dormant lead scanner (finds contacts you haven't reached out to)
- FORD note tracking and relationship intelligence
- Quick skills like "compare these 2 listings" or "draft a check-in text"

**Looking for 5-10 beta testers** who will:
- Explore all the features
- Give honest feedback on what works and what doesn't
- Help shape the roadmap

**Completely free during beta.** CRM sync (FUB, Cloze, Lofty) coming in February.

Drop a comment or DM if interested!

Hey [First Name],

I've been working on something I think you'll find interesting.

You know how we're supposed to track FORD notes, stay in touch with our sphere, and never let relationships go cold? I built an AI assistant that actually helps with that.

**It's called Ninja OS, and here's what it does:**

1. **Voice AI** - Talk to it like you would a chief of staff. Ask questions, get suggestions, think out loud.

2. **Dormant Lead Revival** - Scans your Gmail and finds contacts you haven't reached out to in 6+ months. One click to generate a personalized re-engagement campaign.

3. **FORD Tracking** - Keep relationship notes organized so you never forget what matters to your people.

4. **Quick Skills** - Command palette shortcuts for comparing listings, drafting texts, sending market updates.

**I'm looking for 5-10 beta testers** to try it out and give feedback before I launch more widely.

**What's in it for you:**
- Free access during beta
- Direct line to me for feature requests
- Early adopter pricing when we go live

**What I need from you:**
- Use Gmail (that's what the lead scanner connects to)
- 15-30 minutes/week to explore and share feedback
- Honest opinions on what works and what doesn't

**Fair warning:** CRM integration (Follow Up Boss, Cloze, Lofty) is on the roadmap for February. Right now you can import contacts via CSV or add manually.

If you're interested, just reply to this email with "I'M IN" and I'll send you access.

Spots are limited to keep the feedback manageable, so first come first served.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I'll be at Ninja Now in February with a polished version. Would love to show you how far it's come by then.
