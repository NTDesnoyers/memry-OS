Surrounded by tall trees and buffered by open green space and a small creek, the home feels wrapped in its own little nature preserve, without sacrificing convenience. From the moment you step into the foyer, the updates begin to shine. The main level features fresh 2024-matching laminate flooring throughout the open living and dining areas, tying the space together with warmth and continuity. The kitchen renovation (2018) brings modern flair with sleek tile underfoot, stainless steel appliances including a 2018 dishwasher and gas stove, and smart storage that makes the most of the layout. Upstairs, three spacious bedrooms include two with laminate flooring and one with soft carpet underfoot. The two secondary bedrooms offer peaceful wooded views out back. The full bath has been upgraded with a recent new vanity top, toilet, and hardware, clean, fresh, ready to go.

The 2021 water heater is still young, and recent upgrades include all new toilets and supply lines, energy-efficient LED flush-mount lighting, and anti-tamper outlets throughout.
