The house was remodeled in 2015 and has been lovingly cared for by the sellers since. It&#x2019;s the best of both worlds with fantastic, expansive entertaining space and cozy private space.  The pride of ownership is evident from the moment you pull up to the house. The house comprises of a huge open plan kitchen, dining, living room; with vaulted ceilings, and an abundance of light. On the main level, there&#x2019;s an additional living room, two bedrooms and a bathroom. Upstairs is a wonderful primary suite with two huge walk-in closets and a stylish bathroom with double vanity and shower. There is also a lovely loft area that can be used as a living room, study or whatever you want it to be. This loft space looks over the open plan living area and benefits from the huge windows.  The yard has a fabulous swimming pool, two decks and multiple other sitting areas. There is still a good sized lawn area and plenty of places to plant, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;d like.  No HOA, instead we have a very active civic association which hosts multiple neighborhood events throughout the year including Octoberfest, Halloween parade and chili cook off and Santa visits every year. The community also has its own park at the end of Holmes Run Dr., and plenty of walking trails. The location of this home could not be more convenient for commuters. With easy access to I-495 and the Express Lanes you can be anywhere you need to go in the metro area, quickly and efficiently (I-66 is one exit away on 495 North, Dulles International and National airports in approximately 30 minutes). Commute by metro from Dunn Loring station approximately two miles away (and the bus stop is at the community entrance on Gallows Rd). For those inclined, you can even cycle into DC via the Curtis Trail (many Acres residents do!) Local amenities include Fairview Park, Tysons Corner, Providence Recreation Center, multiple trails and parks, and the wonderful Mosaic District (Angelika film center, Mom & Pop coffee shop, Caboose Brewing Company, Strawberry Park, and many great shops and restaurants). This house and community are truly wonderful.

Welcome to 3017 Pine Spring, a stunning renovation and expansion by Michael Cook of Cook Architecture in the mid-century modern community of Pine Spring in Falls Church. The home features a combination of the original footprint with a soaring, butterfly-roof addition encompassing the living room and private primary suite, which cantilevers 3.5 feet off the foundation. The original home was designed by leading mid-century architects Arthur Keyes, Nicholas Satterlee and Chloethiel Woodard Smith. In 2015, Cook transformed the original 3 bedroom/1 bath 1,060 square-foot atomic ranch into a brand-new modern oasis with 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and 2,215 square-feet. The current owners have made a host of improvements including custom built-ins in all closets, installing custom doors on all closets, had hardwood floors refinished, fully fenced the yard, installed custom blinds, including motorized unites in the living room, and furnishing the house with a Nest thermostat. The interior and exterior of the house have been painted within the last two years and the exterior wood siding has been stained. They planted thriving grass as well. Sited on a .27-acre lot on a quiet cul-de-sac, the home&#x2019;s design and window placement create a sense of privacy while connecting the interior space with the natural surroundings, including large, mature trees. The home features stone patios in the front and back yards and decks leading to separate owners and guest entrances. While maintaining some vintage touches such as the exterior wood siding, the home was completely updated with new plumbing, electrical, insulation and low-E insulated, double-paned windows. White oak floors sealed with low VOC matte sealant were installed throughout the house, which has two HVAC zones covering the original part of the house and the addition. Both furnaces and high-efficiency water heaters. The focus of the home is the open kitchen, dining and living room. The soaring living room addition features exposed structural beams clad in ash, a new powder room and walls of glass while maintaining plenty of wall space for art. Recessed lighting and adjustable art lights have been installed throughout the house. The kitchen, with its large island with seating for three, features Caesarstone quartz countertops and Kitchen Aid stainless steel gas range and refrigerator, and Viking dishwasher. The back splash is crafted from Royal Mossa tile. Ash wood sheathing houses the white, modernist cabinetry and is used in the hall closets. The kitchen is open to the dining area with gas fireplace, skylights and wall of glass looking out to the backyard stone patio. The private primary suite includes a full wall of custom ash closets with walnut shelving and clerestory windows to maximize privacy. Hand-made ceramic sconces by New York-based artists frame one wall while a hanging globe light adds a mid-century touch. The master bathroom has a deep soaking tub, glass enclosed shower and double sinks. In addition to the primary suite, the house has three other bedrooms with good storage space and a renovated full bathroom. All bathrooms are finished with white Italian wall tile and modernist grey porcelain tile flooring. The exterior of the home is a combination of the restored original wood siding, cement board siding and cedar cut to match the original dimensions. The backyard features a large storage shed, which has been painted. The roof on the original part of the house is tar and gravel while the roof on the addition is a TPO cool-roof membrane that does not absorb heat from the sun.

Do not call owners.***,3Hours,"Welcome to 3017 Pine Spring, a stunning renovation and expansion by Michael Cook of Cook Architecture in the mid-century modern community of Pine Spring in Falls Church. The home features a combination of the original footprint with a soaring, butterfly-roof addition encompassing the living room and private primary suite, which cantilevers 3.5 feet off the foundation. The original home was designed by leading mid-century architects Arthur Keyes, Nicholas Satterlee and Chloethiel Woodard Smith. In 2015, Cook transformed the original 3 bedroom/1 bath 1,060 square-foot atomic ranch into a brand-new modern oasis with 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and 2,215 square-feet. The current owners have made a host of improvements including custom built-ins in all closets, installing custom doors on all closets, had hardwood floors refinished, fully fenced the yard, installed custom blinds, including motorized unites in the living room, and furnishing the house with a Nest thermostat. The interior and exterior of the house have been painted within the last two years and the exterior wood siding has been stained. They planted thriving grass as well. Sited on a .27-acre lot on a quiet cul-de-sac, the home&#x2019;s design and window placement create a sense of privacy while connecting the interior space with the natural surroundings, including large, mature trees. The home features stone patios in the front and back yards and decks leading to separate owners and guest entrances. While maintaining some vintage touches such as the exterior wood siding, the home was completely updated with new plumbing, electrical, insulation and low-E insulated, double-paned windows. White oak floors sealed with low VOC matte sealant were installed throughout the house, which has two HVAC zones covering the original part of the house and the addition. Both furnaces and high-efficiency water heaters. The focus of the home is the open kitchen, dining and living room. The soaring living room addition features exposed structural beams clad in ash, a new powder room and walls of glass while maintaining plenty of wall space for art. Recessed lighting and adjustable art lights have been installed throughout the house. The kitchen, with its large island with seating for three, features Caesarstone quartz countertops and Kitchen Aid stainless steel gas range and refrigerator, and Viking dishwasher. The back splash is crafted from Royal Mossa tile. Ash wood sheathing houses the white, modernist cabinetry and is used in the hall closets. The kitchen is open to the dining area with gas fireplace, skylights and wall of glass looking out to the backyard stone patio. The private primary suite includes a full wall of custom ash closets with walnut shelving and clerestory windows to maximize privacy. Hand-made ceramic sconces by New York-based artists frame one wall while a hanging globe light adds a mid-century touch. The master bathroom has a deep soaking tub, glass enclosed shower and double sinks. In addition to the primary suite, the house has three other bedrooms with good storage space and a renovated full bathroom. All bathrooms are finished with white Italian wall tile and modernist grey porcelain tile flooring. The exterior of the home is a combination of the restored original wood siding, cement board siding and cedar cut to match the original dimensions. The backyard features a large storage shed, which has been painted. The roof on the original part of the house is tar and gravel while the roof on the addition is a TPO cool-roof membrane that does not absorb heat from the sun. Pine Spring, the mid-century modern community of 130 homes, is conveniently located inside the Beltway just off Route 50.
