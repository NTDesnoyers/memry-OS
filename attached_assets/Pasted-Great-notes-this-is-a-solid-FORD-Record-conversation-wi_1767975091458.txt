## 1️⃣ Email to Dennis — availability + warm relational touch

This keeps it service-forward, acknowledges their ongoing “maybe someday” downsizing conversation without pushing, and moves the landscaping consult forward.

Hi Dennis,

Great catching up today — I’m glad to hear you and [husband’s name] are still enjoying life up there (even if the “maybe two more years” joke keeps coming back around 😊).

For the landscaping consult, I’m happy to come by next week. Here are a few windows that work well on my end — let me know what lines up for you:

* [Day], [Time range]
* [Day], [Time range]
* [Day], [Time range]

Once we pick a time, I’ll plan to walk the property with you and talk through ideas and priorities.

Looking forward to it,
Nathan

**Why this works (Ninja-style):**

* Service-first
* Light relational humor
* No pressure around downsizing (just planted awareness)
* Clear next step

## 2️⃣ Intro email — Dennis ↔ Ricardo Noserale (BNI kitchens & baths)

This positions Ricardo as a resource, not a sales push.

Dennis & Ricardo,

Wanted to make a quick introduction.

Dennis — meet Ricardo Noserale. Ricardo is a kitchens and baths general contractor I work closely with through BNI. He does great work and is someone I trust when clients are thinking through renovations or upgrades.

Ricardo — Dennis and his husband own a beautiful home and are doing some landscaping and home planning. I thought it’d be helpful for you two to connect in case kitchens, baths, or future projects come into the picture.

I’ll let you both take it from here.

Best,
Nathan
