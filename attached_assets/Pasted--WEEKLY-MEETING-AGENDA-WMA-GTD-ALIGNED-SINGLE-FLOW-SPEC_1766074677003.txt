# WEEKLY MEETING AGENDA (WMA)
## GTD-ALIGNED, SINGLE-FLOW SPEC
## WITH AI INTERRUPTION RULES
## (FOR REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION)

---

# CORE DESIGN INTENT

- There is **one weekly review flow**, not multiple pages competing for attention.
- The flow follows **GTD cognitive order**:
  1. Get Clear
  2. Get Current
  3. Get Creative
- Ninja systems are embedded **inside** this order.
- AI behavior is explicitly controlled:
  - When to stay silent
  - When to assist
  - When to challenge

This document defines **exact structure + AI behavior contracts**.

---

# GLOBAL RULES

## Layout
- Persistent left-side navigation on all panes.
- Weekly Review is a **single guided flow**, broken into collapsible sections.
- User can pause and resume.

## AI Rules (Global)
- AI NEVER interrupts during “Get Clear”.
- AI ASSISTS (quietly) during “Get Current”.
- AI MAY CHALLENGE during “Get Creative”.

# AI INTERRUPTION RULES (SUMMARY)

## AI MUST STAY SILENT WHEN:
- User is unloading thoughts (Get Clear)
- User is entering raw data
- User is reflecting emotionally
- User did not explicitly request help

## AI MAY ASSIST WHEN:
- Prep is requested
- Drafting is needed
- Research is needed
- Organization is requested

## AI MAY CHALLENGE WHEN:
- Patterns repeat over weeks
- Ratings diverge from behavior
- Systems are flagged consistently
- ONLY in Get Creative section

---

# ENGINEERING NOTE (IMPORTANT)

- Each system = modular component
- Weekly Review = ordered container
- GTD order is enforced at top level
- Ninja systems are swappable modules inside Get Current

---

# PHILOSOPHY (DO NOT CODE, BUT HONOR)

This is not a form.
This is a ritual.
The software exists to:
- Tell the truth
- Reduce noise
- Support consistent excellence
