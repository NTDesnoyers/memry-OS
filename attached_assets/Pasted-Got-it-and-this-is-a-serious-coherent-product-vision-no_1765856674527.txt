Got it — and this is a serious, coherent product vision, not a toy app.

What you’re asking for now is essentially “define the instructions / spec for Replit (and future AI agents) to build a fully fledged Ninja Selling OS.”
Below is a clear, opinionated, build-ready instruction set you can paste into Replit or use as your product spec.

I’ll structure this like a founder-level PRD + system instructions, not vague ideas.

⸻

🎯 PRODUCT VISION (ONE SENTENCE)

Build a single-user Ninja Selling Operating System that unifies Weekly Meeting Agenda (WMA), FORD & Record, client intelligence, and business tracking — with automated data sync to Cloze for relationship memory and follow-up intelligence.

⸻

🧠 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These are instructions, not suggestions.
	1.	Ninja-first, not CRM-first
The app reflects how Ninja Selling works, not how CRMs think.
	2.	One source of truth
All activity is entered once, then reused everywhere.
	3.	Separation of concerns
	•	Relationships ≠ Deals ≠ Weekly reflection
	•	But they must link cleanly
	4.	Fast weekly entry
	•	WMA must take <10 minutes
	•	FORD entries <60 seconds per interaction
	5.	Data > UI
	•	Flat, queryable schemas
	•	Exportable at any time
	6.	Cloze is downstream
	•	This app is the thinking layer
	•	Cloze is the memory + reminder layer

⸻

🏗️ APP MODULES (WHAT EXISTS)

1️⃣ Weekly Meeting Agenda (WMA Module)

Purpose

Capture weekly execution, self-honesty, and results.

Core entity

weekly_report

Required features
	•	One report per week
	•	Editable after submission
	•	Historical trend views

Data captured
	•	Weekly snapshot ratings (business, time/energy, Ninja)
	•	Full Ninja habit ratings (1–10)
	•	Habit counts where applicable
	•	Weekly results (offers, contracts, closings, appointments)
	•	Reflection text (wins, a-has, concerns, improvements)
	•	Coach message

Critical behavior
	•	Pre-fill last week’s values
	•	Warn if a week is skipped
	•	Allow backdating

⸻

2️⃣ FORD & Record Module (Relationship Intelligence)

Purpose

Capture relationship signal, not just contact history.

Core entities
	•	person
	•	interaction
	•	ford_record

FORD entry rules

Each interaction:
	•	Person (or household)
	•	Date
	•	Context (call, voicemail, in-person, event)
	•	FORD notes:
	•	Family
	•	Occupation
	•	Recreation
	•	Dreams
	•	Follow-up ideas
	•	Emotional tone (optional)

Critical behaviors
	•	Multiple interactions per person
	•	Weekly FORD count auto-rolls into WMA
	•	One-click “log voicemail” counts as interaction

⸻

3️⃣ Client Intelligence Layer (The Glue)

Purpose

Create a single living profile per person.

Each person aggregates:
	•	All FORD records
	•	All deals
	•	All reviews
	•	Last contact date
	•	Hot / warm / nurture status
	•	Tags (investor, buyer, seller, Rotary, BNI, etc.)

This is not a CRM pipeline — it’s relationship context.

⸻

4️⃣ Business Tracker Module (Execution OS)

Submodules (all linked to people)

🔥 Hot / Warm Lists
	•	Status per person
	•	Reason they’re hot/warm
	•	Last meaningful contact
	•	Next action

📊 PIE Tracker
	•	Income-producing activity logged weekly
	•	Links to WMA habit counts
	•	Tracks $/hour over time

🗓️ Planner
	•	Weekly priorities
	•	Links to people + deals
	•	Does NOT replace Todoist — complements it

⸻

5️⃣ Real Estate Review Planner

Purpose

Make reviews intentional and trackable.

For each review:
	•	Person
	•	Property address
	•	Review date
	•	Prep notes
	•	Outcome notes
	•	Follow-up scheduled

Auto-links to:
	•	FORD
	•	Post-closing follow-up
	•	Future touches

⸻

6️⃣ Post-Closing Follow-Up Engine

Purpose

Protect long-term relationship equity.

For each closed deal:
	•	Auto-generate follow-up timeline:
	•	1 week
	•	30 days
	•	90 days
	•	6 months
	•	Annual

Each follow-up:
	•	Creates a task
	•	Syncs to Cloze
	•	Logs interaction when completed

⸻

🔄 CLOZE INTEGRATION (DOWNSTREAM SYNC)

Cloze is used for:
	•	Contact memory
	•	Reminders
	•	Email/calendar context

Data sent to Cloze

For each person:
	•	Name
	•	Email / phone
	•	Tags
	•	Last interaction date
	•	Notes (summarized, not raw dumps)

Sync rules
	•	App is source of truth
	•	Cloze receives:
	•	Interaction summaries
	•	Relationship tags
	•	Follow-up tasks
	•	No editing in Cloze feeds back upstream (read-only mirror)

⸻

🗄️ DATABASE PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)
	•	Flat tables
	•	Explicit foreign keys
	•	No polymorphic magic
	•	Every record time-stamped

Core tables
	•	people
	•	interactions
	•	ford_records
	•	weekly_reports
	•	deals
	•	reviews
	•	followups

⸻

🤖 AI / ANALYTICS LAYER (PHASE 2)

The app must support these questions:
	•	“Which habits predict closings for me?”
	•	“Where do my ratings diverge from reality?”
	•	“Who haven’t I meaningfully connected with in 90 days?”
	•	“What happened before my best quarter?”

AI does analysis and synthesis, not data entry.

⸻

🚧 WHAT NOT TO BUILD (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ No multi-user permissions (yet)
❌ No public-facing UI
❌ No mobile-first polish
❌ No gamification
❌ No pipeline drag-and-drop
❌ No notifications explosion

If it doesn’t:
	•	Improve self-honesty
	•	Improve relationships
	•	Improve decision quality

…it doesn’t ship.

⸻

🧭 BUILD ORDER (DO NOT DEVIATE)
	1.	People + FORD interactions
	2.	Weekly Meeting Agenda
	3.	Hot/Warm lists
	4.	Deal & Review tracking
	5.	Cloze sync
	6.	Analytics / AI summaries

⸻

🧩 FINAL INSTRUCTION YOU CAN PASTE INTO REPLIT

“Build a single-user Ninja Selling Operating System that unifies weekly execution (WMA), relationship intelligence (FORD & Record), client context, and business tracking.
Prioritize clean data models, fast weekly entry, and long-term pattern recognition.
This is a thinking tool, not a CRM.
Cloze is downstream for memory and reminders; this app is the source of truth.”

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Design the exact database schema
	•	Help you write AI prompts for weekly/monthly synthesis
	•	Help you define v1 vs v2 scope
	•	Or help you decide where this should stop so it doesn’t eat your life

This is the right ambition — now it’s about disciplined execution.
