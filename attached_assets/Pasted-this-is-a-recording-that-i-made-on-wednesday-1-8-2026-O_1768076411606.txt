this is a recording that i made on wednesday 1/8/2026  Okay, so I just left the Nova Real Estate Investor Meetup. We do it once a month, first Wednesday of the month in Tyson's Food Court and had some great conversations. This is going to be my after-the-fact raw dump of who I talk to, what I learned from them, etc. We met Matt Smalley, he is a fireman who works in Springfield and he lives in Harrisonburg.

and commutes to Springfield. He owns a home, a rental in Stafford. Nice guy, tall, had a really thick mustache, glasses. Um, he potentially could be a good source of off-market deals, um, we're going to keep in touch, maybe, uh, send him some information, some follow-up tasks for him would be, um, add his name to the database, uh, send him a handwritten note, um, saying it was great to meet him, um, and also send him some good podcasts and finding off-market deals.

Um, I also chatted with Matt Ingram, uh, he is, I met him before, he lives in D.C., um, he's a paraglider, he just bought a, an investment property in...

Bailey Colorado an Airbnb out there that he doesn't really enjoyed fixing up really enjoyed being out there doing a lot of the work it's $670k for it and put, 10% down he does a lot of private money lending from his 401k and said that he would pay points to if I connected him with a borrower so that's a cool phase.

for that so follow-up note would be to send him a text just saying was great to meet him and to maybe just ask for a little more information on exactly how to do that what he's found to be successful etc he does a hundred percent financing. for flips so that is really interesting to know um i met a shannon erickson she is a house hacker.

lives in hyattsville maryland um also owns a property in dc in pleasant valley um follow up for her is to write her handwritten note and send her real estate reviews um also do a real estate review for matt ingram um uh talked with KC Ico, He is somebody who I met a year or two ago at a meetup, but he'd also known me through bowling, and he was shopping for a house hack and interviewed with me and ended up buying with somebody else. His house hack in Springfield is going well. He has a setup where he does run by the room and where he has a known number or known cost of utilities and where he will tell the people that, hey, if this goes like 20% over the historical normal for utilities, you will get charged.

So follow up for him is to shoot him a text saying, hey, it was great seeing you at the meetup. Can you give me the details on how you set up? The the utility splitting charging program by the room. I spoke with Daniel Dang. He's going to connect me with Manny, who is somebody who's in real estate and tech, as somebody who thinks we could be a good connection with. It's really exciting about vibe coding.

Pete Siler, he got engaged in November, is getting married in May. Nice guy, nice to see him again. You know, he is not, I'd say let's keep him in my database, maybe give him an updated real estate review if I haven't recently, just send him a text saying that it was good to see him at the meetup and congrats again on the engagement.

Rahul Sharma, he is a flipper, lives in Woodbridge, has a rental property in Fredericksburg, so add him to my investor list. Send him a handwritten note and do a real estate review for him and do a real estate review for Matt Smalley.

for his home in Stafford and that's all that I can remember so far so.

so yeah this is uh you know a post event data dump um yeah, tag all of these as investors in my database
