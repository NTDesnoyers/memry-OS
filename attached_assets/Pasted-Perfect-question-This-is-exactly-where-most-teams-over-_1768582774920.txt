Perfect question. This is exactly where most teams **over-engineer themselves into paralysis**. You’re right to stop and sanity-check it.

Short answer first, then I’ll lock the rule and give you the **final dashboard contract**.

---

## The Correct Mental Model (Lock This)

You are **not** pricing:

* AI messages
* AI modes
* Token usage
* “Reflection vs Action”

You are pricing:

> **Ongoing relationship memory and follow-through reliability**

Everything the AI does serves **one outcome**.

So the coach is right.

---

## ✅ The Canonical Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **All AI costs are amortized across logged conversations.**

### Formula (always true):

```
Cost per logged conversation
= Total AI cost (7d / 30d)
÷ Total logged conversations (7d / 30d)
```

That’s it. No branches. No exceptions.

---

## Why Reflection Mode Does NOT Break This Model

Let’s use your exact scenario.

### Example:

* Day 1: You log a call with John (Action Mode)
* Day 2: You ask the AI:

  * “What follow-ups did I miss?”
  * “Summarize John’s timeline”
  * “What should I say next?”

**What’s the user buying?**

Not “analysis tokens.”

They’re buying:

> “This conversation stays useful over time.”

Reflection Mode **increases the value** of the original logged conversation. Therefore:

👉 Its cost belongs to that conversation.

This is **classic unit economics amortization**. Same logic as:

* Customer support cost amortized across customers
* Hosting cost amortized across active users
* Onboarding cost amortized across revenue

---

## The Litmus Test (Use This Forever)

Ask yourself:

> “If the user never logged conversations, would they use Reflection Mode?”

No.

Therefore:

* Logged conversations = **value unit**
* Reflection = **value amplifier**
* Cost belongs to the unit

---

## What This Unlocks (Important)

This model does two powerful things:

### 1️⃣ Keeps pricing simple and defensible

You can say:

> “Each conversation you capture costs us money to store, analyze, and support over time.”

That makes pricing intuitive.

### 2️⃣ Surfaces power users naturally

If someone:

* Logs 20 conversations
* Asks 100 questions about them

Their **cost per conversation goes up**.

That’s not a bug.
That’s your **tier boundary signal**.

---

## FINAL Dashboard Contract (Authoritative)

### Metric Definitions (Freeze These)

**Logged Conversation**

* A persisted real-world interaction
* Created via AI assistant
* Saved successfully

**Total AI Cost**

* All AI usage by the user
* Action + Reflection + Research
* No exclusions

**Cost per Conversation**

```
Total AI Cost ÷ Logged Conversations
```

---

## What to Track (V1)

Per user (beta only by default):

* Logged conversations (7d / 30d)
* Total AI cost (7d / 30d)
* Cost per logged conversation (7d / 30d)

Summary:

* Median cost per conversation (beta)
* Median cost per user (beta, 30d)

---

## What NOT to Track (Yet)

Do **not** add:

* Mode-specific cost breakdowns
* Message counts
* Reflection vs Action ratios
* Token efficiency metrics

Those are **engineering diagnostics**, not business metrics.

If later you see:

> “Power users have 3× reflection cost”

That’s when you instrument deeper. Not now.

---

## The Only Optional Add (If You Want One)

If you *really* want a safety valve without complexity:

Internally (not surfaced in UI):

* Tag AI calls with `mode = action | reflection`
* Keep it for debugging only

Do **not** expose it.
Do **not** price off it.

---

## Final Truth (This Is the Line to Remember)

> **Users pay for durable relationship memory, not AI interactions.**
> **So you price the unit of memory, not the unit of computation.**

You’ve landed on a clean, scalable mental model. Lock it and move forward.

If you want, next we:

* Derive **pricing tiers from observed cost bands**
* Or define **hard beta kill metrics**

Your call.
