Real Estate Review System – Replit Build Instructions (v1)
Project Goal
Build a Real Estate Review system that allows a realtor to create, manage, and deliver comprehensive annual home reviews that combine:
Manual data accuracy
Visual Pricing inputs
Market context
Digital delivery (Gamma)
Print-ready outputs
Task-based workflow execution
This system must be fast, repeatable, and opinionated, not overly flexible.
Core Principles
Manual data entry is intentional
Accuracy > automation (for v1)
Visual Pricing already exists
Do not rebuild pricing logic
Digital-first, print-optional
Workflow-driven
Reviews generate tasks automatically
Future AI-friendly
Structure data cleanly for later agents

Core User Flows
Flow 1: Create Real Estate Review
Entry Point
Left Nav → Real Estate Reviews → “Create Review”
Modal / Page
Fields:
Review Title
Property Address
Neighborhood
Client
Client Type (Prospect / Past Client)
Output Type:
Digital Only
Digital + Print
On Submit
Create RealEstateReview record
Initialize empty sections
Generate task bundle (see below)
Flow 2: Populate Review Data
Each section is edited independently:
Cover Page (static template)
Financial Checklist (manual)
Component Tracker (manual)
Public Records (manual paste/upload)
Visual Pricing (reference existing export)
Market Data (upload or paste PDFs/images)
No calculations are performed inside Replit.
Flow 3: Generate Outputs
Digital Output
Export structured data to Gamma
Create a landing page draft
Store Gamma link in review record
Print Output (Optional)
Two templates:
Standard Print
Book of Records Insert
Generate print-ready PDF (no binding logic).
Task Automation (Critical Feature)
When a review is created, auto-generate tasks:
TaskBundle {
  "Create review record"
  "Populate data"
  "Generate Gamma page"
  "Record Loom walkthrough"
  "Send review (email/text)"
  "Follow-up call"
  "Print & deliver" (if applicable)
}
Tasks should:
Appear in a task list
Be checkable
Be timestamped
Scheduling Logic (v1)
If a contact has a home purchase anniversary, auto-create a draft review during that week.
Reviews appear on dashboard as:
Upcoming
In Progress
Completed
No calendar sync required for v1.
What NOT to Build (Explicitly)
❌ No AI valuation
❌ No MLS scraping
❌ No pricing logic
❌ No automated market pulling
❌ No Replit chart rendering
All intelligence lives in structure + workflow, not computation.
