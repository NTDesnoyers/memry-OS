2026-01-13T14:19:47.717Z	bug	There is something wrong with this conversation. I misspoke. There should be a way to edit it from anywhere, not just from the Flow section. I'm trying to edit it from Doug Church's profile here.	/people/9305be28-054a-4685-94d7-19addf822537	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			165c0e07-09b6-4ba2-b467-8adc1fdf2866
