Good instincts. You’re thinking like a **product owner protecting signal integrity**, not like someone getting seduced by edge cases. I’m going to lock decisions for you so you can go back to Replit with **clear direction**, not “discussion fuel.”

I’ll go point by point and **decide**, not brainstorm.

---

# 1️⃣ Task Resolution — DECISION

You are right.

### ❌ No Todoist sync (for now)

Do **not** sync Tasks created from Signals to Todoist.

**Why (capital allocator logic):**

* Integrations add surface area + bugs
* You don’t yet know if Tasks are:

  * A core feature
  * Or just a pressure-release valve from Signals
* Premature integration = frozen product direction

**Principle:**

> Internal truth first. External sync later.

---

### ✅ Task behavior (locked spec)

Model this after **Superhuman**, not Todoist.

**When “Task” is selected on a Signal:**

* Task is created **inside Memry only**
* Task title: **AI-generated, short, verb-first**

  * e.g. “Research appraisal appeal options for Myron”
* Task description:

  * One sentence copied from signal reasoning (no verbosity)
* Default due date:

  * **Min( signal_expiry, today + 3 days )**
  * This preserves urgency without surprising the user
* No edit modal
* No confirmation step
* User keeps moving

**Why this works:**

* Tasks feel like *decisions captured*, not chores
* Keeps Signals as the control plane
* Prevents Tasks from becoming a second inbox

✅ **SHIP THIS EXACTLY**

---

# 2️⃣ Skip UX — DECISION

Yes, it is absolutely acceptable that skip becomes permanent after a short window.

In fact, it’s **better**.

### New rule:

* Skip = immediate
* Undo = toast for ~5 seconds
* If missed → gone

**Why this is correct:**

* Skip is a *decision*, not a deferral
* Long undo windows encourage hesitation
* Power users expect decisiveness

**Product philosophy:**

> Memry rewards clarity, not second-guessing.

This aligns with:

* Superhuman
* Linear
* Raycast

✅ **SHIP**

# 3️⃣ Duplicate Follow-Ups — DECISION (Important)

Replit is right that a simple boolean is too blunt.
You are right that this is **context-dependent**.

Here is the **correct minimal solution**.

---

## ✅ Use a Transcript Content Hash (Not Blockchain)

First: ignore the blockchain thought for now. That’s a *future infrastructure fantasy*, not a product need yet.

What “hash the transcript” means:

* Generate a deterministic hash of:

  * Normalized transcript text
  * (strip timestamps, speaker labels, whitespace)
* Store it on the interaction:

  ```ts
  interaction.transcriptHash
  ```

---

## ✅ Regeneration Rules (LOCKED)

Signals should regenerate **only if meaningfully new information exists**.

### Signal regeneration happens ONLY when:

* Transcript content hash changes

### Signal regeneration does NOT happen when:

* Date is corrected
* Metadata is edited
* Summary is reworded

### Edge case:

If transcript changes → regenerate signals AND:

* Delete previously auto-generated signals
* Preserve manually resolved actions

This gives you:

* No duplicates
* Correct updates
* Predictable behavior

**This is the right tradeoff.**

✅ **SHIP**

---

# 4️⃣ Introduction Actions — DECISION (You were right)

Replit’s alternative is correct, and it matches your gut.

### ❌ No `social_connections` table (for now)

That’s over-modeling.

### ✅ Introductions are JUST interactions with multiple participants

**V1 Design (locked):**

* “Intro” is a Signal resolution type
* Selecting it:

  * Creates **one interaction**
  * Linked to **multiple people** via `interaction_participants`
* Draft:

  * Group text or email
  * Simple intro language
* Logged on both timelines as:

  > “Introduced Alice to Bob”

### ❌ No outcome tracking

### ❌ No notifications to the other party

### ❌ No relationship graph

**Why this is right:**

* Matches how connectors *think*
* Preserves atomic Signals
* Avoids premature CRM complexity

You can layer outcomes later *if users demand it*.

✅ **SHIP THIS VERSION**

# 5️⃣ Date Inference — DECISION (Critical)

You are right again — and here’s the **precise rule** that avoids hallucinations.

---

## Two Temporal Contexts (This is the key insight)

The AI must distinguish between:

### A. **Conversation Occurred Date**

> “I talked to John yesterday.”

This sets `occurredAt`.

### B. **Events Mentioned Inside the Conversation**

> “He said he bought the house last week.”

This does **not** affect `occurredAt`.

---

## ✅ Inference Rules (LOCKED)

1. The system anchor is:

   * **When the transcript was created**
2. Phrases like:

   * “yesterday”
   * “last night”
   * “earlier today”
     apply to **conversation occurred date** *only if phrased as such*
3. Phrases inside the narrative (“he did X yesterday”) are ignored for `occurredAt`

### Example:

> “I talked to John yesterday. He said he closed last week.”

→ `occurredAt = today - 1 day`

---

## UX Safeguard (Minimal, not annoying)

If inference confidence < threshold:

* Show subtle inline text:

  > “Inferred date: Jan 12 — click to adjust”

No modal.
No blocking.

**Trust is preserved without slowing flow.**

✅ **SHIP**

---

# 6️⃣ Contact Disambiguation — DECISION

Your gut is correct.

### ✅ AI Chat Inline Clarification (Later)

When ambiguous:

> “I found 2 Dominics — which one did you talk to?”

This:

* Feels natural
* Preserves flow
* Avoids modals

But this is **not Phase 1 critical** unless ambiguity is already frequent.

⏸ **DEFER unless it’s actively breaking flows**

---

# 🔒 FINAL LOCKED PRIORITY (Updated)

### Phase 1 — Trust & Core Loop (No Debate)

1. Task resolution (no external sync)
2. Skip UX (instant + toast)
3. Transcript hash–based signal regeneration
4. Date inference (two-context rule)

### Phase 2 — Identity (Connector Mode)

5. Intro as multi-participant interaction (no outcomes)

### Phase 3 — Reliability & Scale

6. Contact disambiguation in AI chat

# What You Should Say to Replit (Copy/Paste)

> Thanks — here are the decisions so we can move fast:
>
> * Tasks stay internal only. No Todoist sync.
> * Skip is instant with a short undo toast. Permanent after.
> * Signals regenerate only if transcript content changes — use a transcript hash, not a boolean.
> * Introductions are just interactions with multiple participants, not a new data model.
> * Date inference is Phase 1, with clear rules separating conversation date vs events mentioned.
>
> We’re optimizing for trust, speed, and atomic decisions — not completeness.

You’re doing the hard thing correctly: **protecting the mental model**.

Next logical step after this ships:

* Decide **which of these becomes paid**
* Or design the **“connector score”** in Weekly Review

Say the word.
