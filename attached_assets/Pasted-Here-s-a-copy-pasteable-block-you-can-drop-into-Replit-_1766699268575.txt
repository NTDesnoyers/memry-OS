Here’s a copy‑pasteable block you can drop into Replit as a prompt or design note:

***

Here are a set of **updated design heuristics** for the product.  

Please:

1. Compare each heuristic with the current system design and behavior.  
2. If we are already doing it, **tighten the implementation** to match the spirit described here.  
3. If any heuristic **contradicts** existing behavior, call that out explicitly and propose options (change the heuristic vs. change the implementation).  
4. For each heuristic, suggest **concrete edits** (data model, flows, defaults, or UI changes) to bring the product into alignment.

### Heuristic 1 – Quiet intelligence, not loud automation
- The system should feel calm, thoughtful, and non‑intrusive.  
- AI should default to *silence* unless:
  - The user explicitly asks for help, or  
  - The user is in a reflection/review ritual (weekly or end‑of‑day).  
- No real‑time nudging, pop‑ups, or attention‑grabbing notifications in v1.  
- AI can queue suggestions in the background, but they should surface only in designated review moments.

**Questions for you:**
- Where in the current design are we “noisy” (real‑time suggestions, alerts, auto‑popups)?  
- For each of those, can we move the behavior into a **batched review surface** instead (weekly review, daily recap, or manual “show insights” action)?

***

### Heuristic 2 – Conversation as primary source of truth
- Conversations (calls, meetings, texts, notes) are the *core* data asset.  
- CRM fields, stages, and scores are **derived annotations** on top of conversation history.  
- The system should feel like it *understands people and relationships*, not just manages records.

**Questions for you:**
- In our current schema and UI, what is treated as primary: conversations or structured CRM entities (contacts, deals, stages)?  
- Can we:
  - Make conversation timelines the default “home” for a person or deal, and  
  - Ensure stage/field changes are always linked back to specific conversations?

***

### Heuristic 3 – Ritual‑centered UX (weekly > daily > real‑time)
- The **weekly review** is the emotional and cognitive center of the product.  
- Daily usage is lightweight and execution‑focused (do the plan, don’t reinvent it).  
- Real‑time interaction is minimal and optional.

**Questions for you:**
- Does the current navigation and onboarding make the *weekly review* feel like the main “home” of the product?  
- Where are we encouraging real‑time checking or dashboard‑watching that could be deferred to weekly or daily rituals instead?

***

### Heuristic 4 – Learnability over raw power
- The product should teach better thinking and workflow just by using it.  
- Avoid hidden modes, magic buttons, or opaque AI decisions.  
- Users should be able to inspect:
  - What the AI noticed, and  
  - Why it suggested something.

**Questions for you:**
- Where do we currently generate suggestions or changes without clear “because…” explanations?  
- For each such place, how can we add:
  - A short “why this” explanation, and  
  - A way to see the exact evidence (conversation snippets, recency, tags) behind the suggestion?

***

### Heuristic 5 – Trust, safety, and psychological comfort
- The product handles intimate conversations and self‑reflection.  
- It must feel non‑judgmental and non‑surveillant.  
- Feedback should feel like **coaching**, not grading.

**Questions for you:**
- Where are we using scores, grades, or harsh labels (e.g., “overdue”, “failed”, “bad”)?  
- Can we replace those with softer, coaching‑oriented language (e.g., “could use attention”, “ready for a touch”, “recently nurtured”) and give users control over which feedback types they see?

***

### Heuristic 6 – Compounding advantage over feature breadth
- Every feature should reinforce at least one compounding loop:
  - Relationship memory  
  - Insight that improves over time  
  - The user’s skill and judgment
- One‑off, isolated features that don’t feed these loops should be cut or deferred.

**Questions for you:**
- Which current or planned features **do not** clearly deepen relationship memory, long‑term insight, or user skill?  
- For each, should we:
  - Cut it,  
  - Defer it, or  
  - Reframe it so it clearly feeds one of the compounding loops?

***

### Heuristic 7 – Opinionated, not configurable‑by‑default
- Early versions should be narrow and strongly opinionated.  
- Avoid extensive settings and per‑user workflow builders.  
- Defaults should embody best practice for relationship‑based work.

**Questions for you:**
- Where have we introduced configuration (settings, toggles, multiple flow options) that a solo practitioner doesn’t really need yet?  
- For each, can we hard‑code a sensible default and remove or hide the configuration for now?

***

### Heuristic 8 – Designed for a small, thoughtful user base first
- Target users: solo agents, advisors, and consultants, not enterprise teams.  
- Optimize for one person owning their relationships and rituals.  
- Team‑level features can come later, if ever.

**Questions for you:**
- Do we currently assume teams, managers, shared workspaces, or complex permissions anywhere in the model or UI?  
- If yes, how can we simplify those areas so the product is clearly built for a single‑owner, solo‑practitioner setup in v1?

***

Using all of the above, please:

1. Produce a **comparison summary** showing:  
   - Strong alignments (where current design already matches these heuristics)  
   - Misalignments or contradictions (where behavior opposes a heuristic)

2. For each misalignment, propose **specific changes** to:  
   - Data model  
   - Flows / screens  
   - Defaults and copy  

3. Flag any heuristics that would require **significant re‑architecture** so they can be discussed before implementation.
