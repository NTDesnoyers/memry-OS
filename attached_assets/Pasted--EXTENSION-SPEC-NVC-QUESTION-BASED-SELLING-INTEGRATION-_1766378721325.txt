# EXTENSION SPEC — NVC + QUESTION-BASED SELLING INTEGRATION
## (Applied to Listening Skill Feedback & Pattern-Based Coaching)

This extension embeds **Nonviolent Communication (NVC)** and **Question-Based Selling** principles into:
- Conversation analysis
- Listening feedback
- Coaching insights

The goal is to:
- Improve empathy and clarity
- Reduce premature problem-solving
- Increase trust and openness
- Train *how* the user listens and responds

This is NOT scripting.
This is **skill refinement**.

---

## CORE FRAMEWORKS USED (INTERNALLY)

### NVC (Marshall Rosenberg — INTERNAL MODEL ONLY)
NVC is used as an **analysis lens**, not shown explicitly to the user.

Internal components:
1. Observation (what happened, without judgment)
2. Feeling (emotion expressed or implied)
3. Need (underlying human need)
4. Request (explicit or implicit ask)

---

### QUESTION-BASED SELLING (INTERNAL MODEL)
Focuses on:
- Curiosity before solutions
- Diagnosis before prescription
- Questions that expand thinking, not steer outcomes

---

## INTEGRATION POINT 1 — LISTENING SKILL FEEDBACK (FEATURE 7)

### NEW ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS (ADDED)

#### 6) OBSERVATION VS INTERPRETATION
Detect whether the user:
- Reflects observable facts (“You mentioned X changed…”)
- Or jumps to interpretation (“So the problem is…”)

Track:
- Frequency of neutral observation
- Frequency of interpretive framing

User-facing language:
- NEVER say “judgment”
- Use phrasing like:
  - “You tend to move quickly from what’s happening to what it means.”

---

#### 7) FEELING ACKNOWLEDGMENT (NVC)
Detect whether the user:
- Names or reflects emotion (explicit or implicit)
- Skips emotion and moves to fixing

Signals:
- “That sounds stressful.”
- “It seems like you’re feeling unsure.”

Track:
- Presence of emotional reflection
- Placement (before vs after solutions)

---

#### 8) NEED CLARIFICATION (NVC)
Detect whether the user:
- Helps surface underlying needs (clarity, certainty, safety, timing, control, reassurance)
- Or assumes needs without checking

Signals:
- “What’s most important to you right now?”
- “What are you hoping this solves?”

---

#### 9) REQUEST SHAPING (NVC)
Detect whether:
- The other person makes a request (explicit or implicit)
- The user confirms the request before responding

Signals:
- “What would be most helpful right now?”
- “Are you looking for advice or just to talk this through?”

---

## UPDATED LISTENING FEEDBACK OUTPUT RULES

Listening feedback may now reference:
- Emotional pacing
- Curiosity before solutions
- Clarifying needs before acting

### EXAMPLE OUTPUTS
- “You often move into problem-solving before checking what the person actually needs.”
- “When uncertainty shows up, you tend to skip reflecting emotion and go straight to answers.”
- “Your strongest conversations happen when you clarify what the person is asking for before responding.”

Still:
- No scores
- No NVC jargon
- No sales language

---

## INTEGRATION POINT 2 — QUESTION-BASED SELLING (FEATURE 8)

### QUESTION QUALITY — EXPANDED CLASSIFICATION

Classify user questions into:

1. Exploratory (opens space)
   - “Can you tell me more about that?”
2. Clarifying (refines understanding)
   - “When you say X, what does that look like?”
3. Feeling-based (NVC-aligned)
   - “How did that feel when it happened?”
4. Need-based (NVC-aligned)
   - “What matters most to you here?”
5. Solution-leading (premature)
   - “Have you considered doing X?”
6. Closed (limits depth)
   - Yes/No questions

Track:
- Ratio of exploratory/clarifying vs solution-leading
- Correlation to depth of response

---

## PATTERN-BASED COACHING — UPDATED OUTPUT TYPES

### A) NVC-ALIGNED MICRO SHIFTS
AI may suggest *one* small change at a time.

Examples:
- “Try reflecting what you hear before offering advice.”
- “Try asking what they need before solving.”
- “Try naming the emotion you hear and pausing.”

---

### B) QUESTION SWAPS (VERY POWERFUL)
Format:
- “When you ask X instead of Y, conversations go deeper.”

Examples:
- “When you ask ‘What’s worrying you most?’ instead of offering reassurance, people open up more.”
- “When you ask ‘What would be most helpful right now?’ instead of giving advice, trust increases.”

This is **question-based selling without selling language**.

---

## DELIVERY RULES (UNCHANGED, BUT STRICT)

- Coaching appears ONLY:
  - In Get Creative
  - Or when user explicitly asks for coaching
- NEVER mid-conversation
- NEVER during execution
- NEVER as alerts or notifications

---

## LEARNING LOOP — NVC-SENSITIVE

When user responds to coaching:
- “That’s accurate” → reinforce pattern detection
- “That’s not right” → reduce weight
- “Tell me more” → expand with examples

AI should learn:
- Which NVC-style feedback resonates
- Which feels intrusive or unhelpful

---

## SAFETY & TRUST GUARDRAILS (CRITICAL)

- NEVER label behavior as:
  - “Wrong”
  - “Manipulative”
  - “Salesy”
- NEVER imply intent
- ALWAYS frame as:
  - Observation
  - Choice
  - Option

The system supports **self-awareness**, not correction.

---

## SUMMARY (FOR ENGINEERING)

This extension:
- Adds NVC and question-based selling as **internal lenses**
- Improves listening feedback quality
- Sharpens pattern-based coaching
- Preserves Ninja philosophy
- Avoids scripting and manipulation

This is **coaching intelligence**, not persuasion automation.
