Absolutely. Here is a clean, copy-paste-ready response with no meta framing, suitable to drop directly into Replit.

These are the right implementation questions. Here are clear decisions on each, optimized for v1 speed and correctness:

⸻

1. Deduplication

Decision: Light deduplication only in v1.

Approach:
	•	Deduplicate by:
	•	person_id
	•	experience.type
	•	logged_at within the same processing window / conversation
	•	Do not attempt semantic similarity or embedding-based dedupe yet.

Rationale:
	•	Duplicate experiences are low-cost and reversible.
	•	Missing a meaningful experience is high-cost and irreversible.
	•	Experience records should be treated as append-only observations in v1.

Cleanup and consolidation can happen later once real data exists.

⸻

2. One-to-Many Extraction

Decision: Extract all meaningful experiences from a single conversation.

Approach:
	•	One conversation can yield multiple experience records.
	•	Each experience gets its own:
	•	type
	•	summary
	•	magnitude_score
	•	acknowledged flag

Rationale:
	•	Real conversations often surface multiple independent life events.
	•	Collapsing them loses meaning and forces generic follow-ups.
	•	Signal ranking will naturally prioritize the most important experiences.

⸻

3. Existing Signals Without Experiences

Decision: This behavior is intentional and correct.

Approach:
	•	experience_id on signals is nullable.
	•	Signals backed by unacknowledged, high-magnitude experiences should rank above time-based or routine signals.
	•	Existing signals continue to function normally, just with lower priority.

Rationale:
	•	This preserves backward compatibility.
	•	It gradually shifts the system from time-based pressure to meaning-based pressure.
	•	No migrations or rewrites required.

⸻

4. Magnitude Calibration

Decision: The proposed magnitude scale is correct and should be locked.

Scale:
	•	5 – Life-altering (death, birth, divorce, major health crisis)
	•	4 – Major milestone (promotion, home purchase, engagement)
	•	3 – Notable transition (new job, moving, kid starting school)
	•	2 – Everyday life (vacation, minor wins, routine updates)
	•	1 – Ambient context (weather, casual chatter)

Implementation guidance:
	•	Default ambiguous cases to 2.
	•	Assign 4–5 only when language is explicit.
	•	Be conservative; it’s easier to escalate later than downgrade.

⸻

Summary
	•	Accept some experience duplication in v1.
	•	Extract multiple experiences per conversation.
	•	Let experience-backed signals naturally outrank others.
	•	Use a simple, conservative magnitude scale.

With these decisions, the v1 scope is clear and ready to build.
