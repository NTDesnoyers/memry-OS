WHO IT’S FOR (SHORT, OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

For relationship-based real estate agents who:
	•	Talk to a lot of people every week
	•	Rely on referrals and repeat business
	•	Hate updating CRMs
	•	Know follow-up makes money — but struggle to stay consistent

(Do NOT add a CTA here.)

HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Section Header

How Flow OS works
	1.	Log a conversation
Talk or type naturally — no formatting required.
	2.	Flow OS extracts what matters
People, topics, action items, and FORD insights.
	3.	Get the right follow-up instantly
See who to contact next and exactly what to say.

This reinforces the mental model without overexplaining.
