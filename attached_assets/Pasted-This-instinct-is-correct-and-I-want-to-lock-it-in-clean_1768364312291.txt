This instinct is correct — and I want to lock it in cleanly so you don’t overbuild.

⸻

DECISION (FINAL, NO WIGGLE)

V1 = Experience extraction only.
Awe triggers stay conceptual, not structural (yet).

You do not ship the awe taxonomy table in v1.

Why:
	•	Experience extraction is the hard, high-signal part
	•	Awe classification is a refinement layer, not a dependency
	•	Premature taxonomy = false precision + complexity
	•	You’ll learn which experiences actually matter before labeling them

This is exactly how a disciplined Lean system should evolve.

⸻

HOW TO THINK ABOUT AWE IN V1 (IMPORTANT)

Awe is implicit, not explicit, in v1.

In v1:
	•	Awe = magnitude_score ≥ 3 AND unacknowledged
	•	No trigger labels
	•	No facet modeling
	•	No taxonomy debates

You are still building awe mechanics, you’re just not naming them yet.

That’s correct sequencing.

⸻

CONFIRMED V1 SCOPE (LOCKED)

What you outlined is exactly right.
I’m going to restate it crisply so engineering has zero ambiguity.

✅ V1 INCLUDES
	1.	Experiences table
	•	person_id
	•	type (life_event | achievement | struggle | transition)
	•	summary
	•	emotional_valence (optional but useful)
	•	magnitude_score (1–5)
	•	acknowledged (boolean)
	2.	Conversation processor upgrade
	•	Extract experiences automatically
	•	Persist them
	•	Be conservative (default magnitude = 2–3)
	3.	Signals reference experiences
	•	Add experience_id to follow_up_signals
	•	Signals may exist without experiences, but not vice versa
	4.	Ranking logic
	•	Unacknowledged experiences
	•	Higher magnitude first
	•	Time-based signals fall below meaning-based ones
	5.	Resolution behavior
	•	Resolving a signal tied to an experience → acknowledged = true
	•	This is critical (closure + no repeat nagging)
	6.	Draft generation upgrade
	•	Drafts receive experience context
	•	No awe language, just grounded specificity

This is a powerful v1. Anything more would be ego.

⸻

❌ EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE FOR V1

Do not build these yet:
	•	Awe trigger taxonomy table
	•	Explicit awe classification
	•	Facet scoring (self-diminishment, connectedness, etc.)
	•	Manual experience logging UI
	•	User-facing “meaning” labels
	•	Any educational explanation of awe

Those come after you see real data.

⸻

WHY THIS SEQUENCING IS STRATEGIC

You are following the exact pattern of strong systems:
	1.	Capture reality
	2.	Persist meaning
	3.	Act on it
	4.	Observe outcomes
	5.	Only then classify

Most products try to classify before they understand reality.
You’re doing the opposite.

That’s how you end up with a moat instead of a taxonomy.

ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

Should I create the task list for this? Or refine scope first?

Create the task list. Scope is already tight enough.

So here’s the directive:

👉 Yes — create the task list.
But structure it exactly like this:

⸻

TASK LIST STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Break it into 4 epics, not random tickets:

Epic 1: Experience Persistence
	•	Add experiences table
	•	Add indexes (person_id, acknowledged, magnitude_score)

Epic 2: Conversation → Experience Extraction
	•	Update processor prompt
	•	Confidence thresholding
	•	Safe defaults (don’t block pipeline)

Epic 3: Signals Integration
	•	Add experience_id to signals
	•	Update ranking logic
	•	Update resolution behavior

Epic 4: Draft Context Upgrade
	•	Pass experience summary into draft generation
	•	Remove generic fallback phrasing

Each epic should be independently shippable.

⸻

ONE LAST IMPORTANT NOTE (DON’T MISS THIS)

When you do add awe triggers later, they should be:
	•	Derived, not stored initially
	•	Re-runnable on historical experiences
	•	Optional, not required for action

That’s future-proofing — but not today’s work.

⸻

NEXT STEP (EXECUTION)

Reply with one of these:

1️⃣ “Here’s the task list — sanity check it”
2️⃣ “Write the exact experience-extraction prompt for the conversation processor”
3️⃣ “Help me define the signal ranking formula precisely”

Pick one. We keep moving.
