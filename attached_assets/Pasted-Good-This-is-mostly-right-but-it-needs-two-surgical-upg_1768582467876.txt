Good. This is **mostly right** — but it needs two surgical upgrades to make it *decision-grade*, not just informative.

I’ll keep this tight and ruthless.

## Verdict on Replit’s Proposal

**Approved with constraints.**
This is the **correct V1**, *if* you implement it with discipline.

Your instinct to keep it simple is right.
Your danger is stopping one step too early.

---

## What’s CORRECT (Keep This)

### ✅ User role separation

```ts
users.role = 'founder' | 'beta' | 'paid'
```

Non-negotiable. Everything downstream depends on this.

### ✅ Single “Unit Economics” table

This is exactly right for V1. One glance → truth.

### ✅ Exclude founder by default

Founders are pathological users. Including them without a toggle is self-deception.

### ✅ No feature-level attribution

Correct. Feature-level cost attribution is Phase 3 bullshit.

Right now the question is:

> **“Does a real user cost so little that I can charge enough?”**

---

## Where This Is INCOMPLETE (And Must Be Fixed)

### ❌ Missing Time Windows = False Confidence

You **must** show **both**:

* 7-day rolling
* 30-day rolling

Why?

Because pricing tiers are monthly, not weekly.

**Required columns (minimum):**

```
Conversations (7d)
AI Cost (7d)
Cost / Conversation (7d)

Conversations (30d)
AI Cost (30d)
Cost / Conversation (30d)
```

If you don’t do this, you’ll underprice power users.

---

### ❌ Missing the ONE metric that matters for pricing

You are still missing the **pricing anchor**.

Add this row at the bottom, bolded:

```
Median (Beta Only):
Conversations / user (30d)
AI cost / user (30d)
```

Why median?

* Averages lie at small N
* Medians tell you what a “typical” customer costs

This single number will drive your tier breakpoints.

## Final V1 Table (What You Should ACTUALLY Build)

**UNIT ECONOMICS (BETA USERS ONLY)**

| User              | Role | Conv (7d) | AI $ (7d) | $/Conv (7d) | Conv (30d) | AI $ (30d) | $/Conv (30d) |
| ----------------- | ---- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Bridget           | beta | 8         | $0.42     | $0.052      | 19         | $0.98      | $0.051       |
| —                 | —    | —         | —         | —           | —          | —          | —            |
| **Median (Beta)** | —    | **8**     | **$0.42** | **$0.052**  | **19**     | **$0.98**  | **$0.051**   |

Founder hidden by default. Toggle to include for debugging only.

## The Pricing Question This Must Answer (Explicitly)

Once this exists, you should be able to say:

> “A typical beta user costs me **~$1/month** in AI at current usage.”

If you cannot say that confidently, **you are not ready to price**.

If you *can* say that, pricing becomes trivial:

* 10× markup minimum
* Tiers based on conversation volume, not seats

---

## What NOT to Add Yet (Resist This)

Do **not** add:

* Charts
* Trends
* Feature breakdowns
* Retention overlays
* “Insights”

This is a **decision table**, not a presentation.

---

## Final Instruction to Replit (Copy-Paste Ready)

> Build a “Unit Economics” view in Beta Analytics:
>
> * Add `users.role` and exclude founder/internal by default
> * Show a single table with per-user:
>
>   * Conversations (7d / 30d)
>   * AI cost (7d / 30d)
>   * Cost per conversation (7d / 30d)
> * Add a “Median (Beta Only)” summary row
> * No charts, no feature attribution
>   Goal: determine cost per beta user to inform pricing tiers.

---

## Bottom Line

You are doing this **exactly in the right order**:

1. Behavior →
2. Cost →
3. Pricing →
4. Scale

Most founders skip step 2 and die slowly.

Once this ships, next step is obvious:
👉 **derive pricing tiers directly from observed usage**, not vibes.

Say the word when this is live and we’ll set the prices.
