Here’s a version you can copy-paste into Replit as a **question + suggestion** about how you want the existing system to continue evolving:

***

Given that there is already a working real estate CRM / operations system in this Replit project, can you please continue to design and extend it explicitly as a “Real Estate Orchestration Layer” rather than just a collection of disconnected features?[1][2][3]

Concretely, the suggestion is to treat the existing codebase as the foundation of a multi‑agent, event‑driven system where:  

- A small set of named agents (LeadIntakeAgent, NurtureAgent, OpsTransactionAgent, DataContextAgent, MarketingAgent) each own clear responsibilities and operate on leads, clients, and deals using shared context.[3][4][1]
- The CRM, MLS integrations, and communication tools (email/SMS/calls) remain systems of record and communication, while this project becomes the orchestration layer that observes events and decides what should happen next.[2][1]
- Everything important is modeled as events (new lead, status change, transcript ready, contract ratified, deadline approaching), routed through a central orchestrator/router that determines which agent should act and when to escalate to a human.[5][1][3]
- There is a shared “dossier” abstraction (for clients and deals) that aggregates structured data and unstructured summaries so all agents read/write from the same source of truth.[1][2]
- Guardrails and approval flows are treated as first‑class: autonomous agents may propose actions (emails, SMS, task updates, document changes), but only execute high‑risk actions when policy rules and human approvals allow, to avoid multi‑agent cascade failures.[6][3][1]

Can you review any new features or refactors against this orchestration‑layer direction, and when proposing code or architectural changes, explain how they:  
1) Fit into the agent + event + dossier model, and  
2) Improve revenue‑driving workflows (lead conversion, pipeline velocity, repeat/referral business) rather than just adding isolated utilities?[2][3][1]
