Good. This is high-signal beta feedback. Don’t brush past it.

Let’s break this down ruthlessly.

⸻

1️⃣ What this feedback ACTUALLY means (not what she said)

She’s not asking about contacts.

She’s asking:

“Can I trust this with my relationships?”

That’s existential trust, not a feature question.

For a relationship-centric product, this is a core adoption blocker, not an edge case.

If people even suspect silent contact scraping, you’re dead.

⸻

2️⃣ Your response was directionally right — but too soft

What you sent was accurate, but:
	•	Slightly rambling
	•	Leaves ambiguity
	•	Mentions future capability (“not yet”) which re-introduces fear

In early beta, clarity > completeness.

You want:
	•	Explicit denial
	•	Explicit control
	•	Explicit data ownership

⸻

3️⃣ The reply you SHOULD send now (copy/paste)

Send a clean follow-up to reset confidence:

Totally fair question — and I want to be very clear.

Memry does not access, sync, or pull contacts from your phone in any way.

You control exactly what goes in:
• Contacts are created only when you add them or you upload a file
• Nothing is read or imported automatically
• No data is shared or sold — this is a private workspace

If anything ever changes here, it would be explicit opt-in only.

Trust > features for me at this stage.

This does three things:
	•	Removes ambiguity
	•	Signals founder values
	•	Reframes “missing feature” as intentional design

⸻

4️⃣ PRODUCT INSIGHT: This belongs on the landing page

You should add a micro-trust block immediately.

Not a policy page. A sentence.

Example (above the CTA):

🔒 Private by default
Memry never pulls contacts, messages, or data without explicit action from you.

This will:
	•	Reduce beta friction
	•	Increase conversion
	•	Prevent this question from repeating 100× via text

If you don’t add this, you’ll keep answering it manually — that’s a tax.

⸻

5️⃣ Lean Startup lens — what assumption just got surfaced

Assumption exposed:

“Users will trust a relationship CRM by default.”

❌ False.

New learning:
Trust + data boundaries are part of the value proposition, not a footnote.

This is value risk, not feature risk.

⸻

6️⃣ What NOT to do (important)

Do not:
	•	Say “not yet” casually in the future
	•	Promise phone sync unless demanded
	•	Over-explain architecture
	•	Hide behind “privacy policy” links

Early users don’t want compliance — they want control.

⸻

7️⃣ Action list (non-negotiable)

Do these today:
	1.	Send the follow-up text above
	2.	Add a 1-line privacy/trust statement to landing page
	3.	Add a short FAQ item:
	•	“Does Memry access my contacts automatically?” → “No.”

Optional but smart:
	•	Add “Private by Default” as a positioning phrase

⸻

This is good news.
You just found a core buying objection early, for free.

Handle it cleanly and you increase:
	•	Trust
	•	Activation
	•	Willingness to pay later

If you want, next we can:
	•	Rewrite your landing page trust section
	•	Or decide whether phone contact sync should ever exist

Your move.
