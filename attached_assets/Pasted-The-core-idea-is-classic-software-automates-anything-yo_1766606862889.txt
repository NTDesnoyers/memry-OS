The core idea is: classic software automates anything you can precisely **specify**; modern AI lets you automate anything you can reliably **verify** as correct or incorrect.  You design verifiers (checks) first, then let AI search for actions that satisfy them.[5][6]

## Concept 1: Specify → Automate (Software 1.0)

- If you can spell out exact rules, inputs, outputs, and edge cases, you can encode them in traditional code.[7]
- Behavior is determined by hand‑written logic; changes require editing rules or adding new ones.[6]

## Concept 2: Verify → Automate (Software 2.0 / AI)

- AI behavior is learned from data and feedback, not fully written as explicit rules.[2]
- As long as there’s a reliable way to check whether an output is “good” (a verifier), you can train or constrain AI to produce mostly good outputs.[3]

## What makes a task “verifiable”

- There is an objective pass/fail or graded criterion: e.g., “email sent without bounce,” “all required CRM fields filled,” “meeting successfully scheduled.”[4]
- The check can be implemented as code, rules, or a deterministic procedure that does not require deep human judgment each time.[3]

## Design pattern: Verifier‑first automation

- For each workflow step, define: success condition, validation rules, and what to do on failure (retry, escalate, ask human).[6]
- Let AI generate drafts/actions, but only commit them if they pass the verifier; otherwise route to a human or request clarification.[4]

## Characteristics of systems built on this framework

- **Explicit success criteria** for every automated step (clear definitions of “done right”).[6]
- **Separation of concerns**: AI proposes actions; verifiers (classic code/rules) accept, reject, or flag them.[3]
- **Risk‑bounded**: high‑impact or low‑verifiability tasks stay human‑in‑the‑loop; low‑risk, easily checked tasks are fully automated.[4]
- **Iteratively improvable**: you can tighten verifiers and improve models over time without rewriting whole workflows.[2]
- **Metrics‑driven**: the system tracks pass rates, exceptions, and human overrides to refine both AI and verifiers.[8]

You can hand this to Replit roughly as: “This OS should treat AI as a proposal engine and classic code as a verifier; every automation must have a coded success check, and only actions that pass those checks should execute automatically.”
