This is the right plan, in the right order, for the right reasons.

I’m going to do three things:
	1.	Approve the sequencing
	2.	Tighten each phase into execution-grade criteria
	3.	Add one hidden dependency per phase that you should address now (to avoid backtracking)

No rehashing theory. This is execution alignment.

⸻

✅ OVERALL VERDICT

Your plan correctly follows the post-invariant reality:

Now that the system tells the truth, we fix whether it’s usable.

You are no longer debugging blindly. You’re stabilizing layers.

Proceed.

⸻

🔴 PHASE 1 — P1 ACTIONS RELIABILITY (APPROVED, MUST BE NEXT)

You’re absolutely right:

The Actions system is broken end-to-end.

This is the execution layer. Signals without actions are insight without leverage.

⸻

PHASE 1 — WHAT “DONE” MEANS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before we talk causes, let’s lock the success criteria, or you’ll ship half-fixes.

✅ Phase 1 is DONE when:
	1.	User clicks Text / Email / Call
	2.	An action record exists in the database
	3.	The action appears immediately in the Actions list
	4.	The user can delete that action
	5.	Page refresh does not change the result

If any one of these fails → Phase 1 is not done.

⸻

🔍 PHASE 1 — INVESTIGATION (YOU FRAMED THIS CORRECTLY)

Your three investigation points are exactly right. Here’s how to execute them cleanly.

⸻

1️⃣ Signal → Action Creation (Start Here)

When resolveFollowUpSignal is called, is an action created?

Do not assume intent. Prove it.

Concrete steps:
	•	Log inside resolveFollowUpSignal
	•	Log after draft/action creation
	•	Manually query DB for the action

Decision tree:
	•	❌ No action created → backend bug
	•	✅ Action created → move to query/UI layer

⚠️ Hidden dependency to check now:
Make sure the action is created inside the same tenant/user scope.
Many “invisible action” bugs are actually tenant filters.

⸻

2️⃣ Actions List Query (/api/actions)

Is the endpoint returning the correct data?

Correct framing.

Common failure points to explicitly test:
	•	Status filtering (e.g. excluding pending_review)
	•	Type filtering (draft vs task vs call)
	•	UserId mismatch
	•	Soft-delete flags
	•	Pagination defaults hiding newest items

Rule:

If the DB has the row and the API doesn’t return it, the API is wrong.

No UI work until the API is correct.

⸻

3️⃣ Delete Action (Why It Fails)

This is a classic “looks small, hides rot” bug.

Check explicitly:
	•	Does the delete endpoint exist?
	•	Does it return 200?
	•	Is it a soft delete?
	•	Does the query exclude deleted actions?
	•	Is the frontend optimistically removing it?

⚠️ Hidden dependency:
If delete works in DB but not UI → cache invalidation again.
Expect to fix this alongside Actions visibility.

⸻

🔒 PHASE 1 — IMPORTANT DESIGN LAW

While fixing Actions, enforce this new invariant:

Every resolved signal must result in either:
	•	a visible action
	•	or a visible dismissal state

No silent resolutions.

This mirrors the signal invariant you just enforced.

⸻

🟡 PHASE 2 — P2 CONTACT UPDATES & WEEKLY REVIEW (APPROVED)

Correctly sequenced. These are confidence bugs, not flow breakers.

⸻

1️⃣ Contact Updates via AI (Cache Discipline)

Your instinct is right:

“Likely cache invalidation or mutation issue”

99% chance that’s correct.

Checklist:
	•	Confirm backend writes correct data
	•	Confirm mutation returns updated object
	•	Invalidate:
	•	Contact detail query
	•	Any derived lists using that contact

⚠️ Hidden dependency:
If contact updates happen during AI flows, make sure AI completion invalidates contact caches, not just interaction caches.

⸻

2️⃣ Weekly Review Dates (Timezone Hygiene)

This is almost certainly:
	•	UTC stored
	•	Local displayed incorrectly
	•	Grouping done before timezone conversion

Rule (lock this in):
	•	Store UTC
	•	Group by user-local day
	•	Display in user-local timezone

Do not overthink it. Fix it once.

⸻

🚫 WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT ADD DURING THESE PHASES

While executing Phases 1 & 2:

Do not:
	•	Add new action types
	•	Improve UI styling
	•	Add GTD statuses
	•	Add AI features
	•	Touch pricing or onboarding

You are stabilizing, not expanding.

⸻

🧠 WHY YOUR PLAN IS GOOD (ZOOMING OUT)

You are now operating like a systems founder:
	•	You fixed truth
	•	Now you’re fixing execution
	•	Then you’ll fix confidence
	•	Only then do you add leverage

Most teams do this backwards.

⸻

FINAL DECISION

✅ Approved as written
🛠 Proceed with Phase 1: Actions Reliability immediately
📏 Use the “DONE” criteria above ruthlessly

If you want next, I can:
	•	Turn Phase 1 into a Replit Agent task list
	•	Or help you write a manual test script for Actions reliability
	•	Or help you decide when you’re ready to demo/sell again

Say which.
