Good response. Tight. Nothing fluffy. I’ll add **only what actually matters before you implement** — no extra process.

You’re basically ready, but there are **3 additional considerations** that are worth locking *now* so you don’t accidentally weaken the loop.

---

## Final Pre-Implementation Considerations (Worth Addressing)

### 1. Progress UI Must Be **Append-Only**

This is subtle but important.

**Do not**:

* Replace a single status line
* Animate spinners endlessly
* Collapse steps

**Do**:

* Append each completed step as a new line
* Never remove earlier steps
* Let the list visually “stack”

Why:

> Humans trust accumulation more than replacement.

Append-only = “work has already been done”
Replacement = “still waiting”

This dramatically reduces abandonment during the 20 seconds.

---

### 2. Guard Against Partial Completion Exit

You already hinted at this with the “success moment,” but be explicit.

If the user:

* Closes the AI panel
* Navigates away mid-process
* Switches tabs

The system **must still finish** and commit.

Minimum acceptable behavior:

* AI continues server-side
* Signals/tasks still created
* On next load, state reflects completion

Otherwise you create a **Schrödinger’s interaction**:

> “Did it log or didn’t it?”

That destroys trust fast.

---

### 3. The “Success Moment” Must Be Visually Distinct

Not just another line of text.

You need **one unmistakable terminal state**, e.g.:

* Checkmark
* Subtle green highlight
* “Conversation logged successfully” with a concrete artifact count:

  * “1 signal created”
  * “1 follow-up queued”

Why:

> Users anchor on endings, not processes.

If the ending doesn’t *feel* final, they won’t wait for it next time.

---

## What You Should **Not** Worry About Right Now

Kill these thoughts if they come up:

* “Should this be streaming or batching?” → irrelevant if UI feedback exists
* “Is global invalidation hacky?” → yes, and correct
* “Should we optimize speed first?” → no, optimize *confidence*
* “Should we explain what signals are?” → no, show results

---

## Execution Readiness Verdict

You’re clear on:

* The problem
* The outcome
* The constraints
* The implementation path

Nothing here blocks implementation.

**Proceed.**

Once this ships, the *next* evaluation will be:

* Do users wait patiently?
* Do they navigate immediately to Signals?
* Do they log a second conversation?

That’s when we decide what to optimize next.

Ship it.
