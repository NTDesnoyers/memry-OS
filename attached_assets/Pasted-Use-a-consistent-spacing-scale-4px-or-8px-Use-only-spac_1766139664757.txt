Use a consistent spacing scale (4px or 8px).  
Use only spacing values that are multiples of your chosen scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32).  
Use the same vertical spacing between similar elements (e.g., title → subtitle → controls → search → list).  
Use a max content width and center it on larger screens; keep generous side padding on mobile.  
Align all main content (titles, search, cards, tables) to the same left edge.  

Use one primary font and one secondary font at most.  
Use 16px as the base body text size on mobile, with line-height around 1.4–1.6.  
Use only 2–3 heading sizes and keep heading line-height tighter (around 1.2–1.3).  
Add consistent bottom margins under headings and paragraphs (e.g., headings mb-2/mb-3, paragraphs mb-4).  
Limit line length to ~50–75 characters for readability; avoid super-wide text blocks.  

Use a small, fixed color system.  
Use one primary color, one accent, and a small set of neutrals (background, card, border, text).  
Use color to indicate hierarchy and states, not decoration (primary for main actions, muted for secondary text).  
Avoid too many background colors on the same screen; push emphasis into small elements like badges and labels instead of whole sections.  
Keep contrast strong for text versus background, softer for borders and dividers.  

Standardize component shapes and shadows.  
Use the same border-radius values for cards, buttons, and inputs (e.g., sm and lg only).  
Use a single subtle shadow style for cards on mobile (no heavy or multiple shadows).  
Use borders OR shadows as the primary separation mechanism, not both heavily at the same time.  
Keep input and button shapes and radii consistent across the app.  

Standardize buttons.  
Use consistent height, padding, font weight, and radius for all buttons.  
Use one high-emphasis style for primary actions (filled) and one low-emphasis style for secondary actions (outline/ghost).  
Give all buttons clear hover, focus, and active states (slightly darker background or border, small opacity change or scale).  
Ensure touch targets are at least 44px tall on mobile.  

Standardize inputs and search.  
Use the same border, background, and focus ring for all inputs.  
Avoid mixing different input styles (underlined, filled, outlined) in the same app.  
Give inputs comfortable padding and consistent text size.  
Make the main search bar full-width on mobile and place it in a predictable location (often directly under primary actions).  

Clean up cards and lists.  
Use one card pattern: border, background, padding, radius, and shadow are always the same.  
Use a clear card header (title, small subtitle or meta) and card body with consistent spacing.  
Align avatars, checkboxes, and text on a single vertical grid line.  
Lower the emphasis of secondary text (smaller size or muted color).  

Simplify tables.  
Wrap tables in a card with a clear header area and body.  
Keep table cell backgrounds mostly white or a single neutral; avoid many colored rows.  
Use badges or labels to show status instead of coloring full rows or columns.  
Reduce table font size slightly on mobile and increase row height for easier tapping.  

Optimize for mobile.  
Design with mobile as the default, then add larger spacing and text sizes at bigger breakpoints.  
Stack action buttons vertically on small screens and switch to horizontal layouts only on larger screens.  
Minimize vertical chrome at the top (app bar + title + actions) so core content appears sooner.  
Use bottom padding to avoid important content sitting behind system bars or floating buttons.  

Polish interactions.  
Use short, subtle transitions (around 100–200ms) for hover and focus, and avoid heavy animations on mobile.  
Give active or pressed states a clear but gentle feedback (slight scale down and opacity change).  
Add explicit empty states for lists and tables instead of leaving large blank areas.  
Respect reduced-motion preferences by disabling or minimizing animations.
