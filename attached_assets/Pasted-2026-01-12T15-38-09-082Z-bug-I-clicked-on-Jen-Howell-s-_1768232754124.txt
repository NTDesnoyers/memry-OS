2026-01-12T15:38:09.082Z	bug	I clicked on Jen Howell's name and it popped up in her discussions. I was unable to flag an issue so we need to fix that bug. The flag and issue button should be available from every single screen, no matter what. And if I click on it, it should not minimize whatever I'm in. I was trying to access her. She had two conversations. I really only had one and so I was going to edit that from here. I noticed that there's this thing called forward notes when I click on it and it said no forward notes on file. I'd say let's just hide that for now because there's really just no use for that.	/weekly-review	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			7df88d98-a05b-4768-bf54-5db99e13ffee																		
2026-01-12T15:39:12.818Z	bug	My weekly review correctly shows that I've talked to zero out of 50 households so far today. While Flow in the Flow menu shows that I've talked to two out of 50. I believe that this was incorrectly logged from when it counted the handwritten notes that I sent this morning as contacts. So we just need to make sure that that bug is fixed. That any time that the source of truth for what counts as a conversation is the same across all menus.	/weekly-review	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			9ec6a1d3-9e9d-42c5-a1cc-02dbdd8852e6																		
2026-01-12T15:43:06.487Z	bug	In Daniel Dang's timeline it shows that there is a note written to him. This is a mistake; I did not write a note to him. There is a current draft for him actually that's what I came here to check was to see if the drafts in actions show up in the associated person's contact profile, which I think would be a great idea if I'm flipping through somebody's profile and see "I have these drafted actions I should review them."	/people	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			761ab801-ab94-43fb-9826-00a28dd1e446
