You are helping me build an AI-native, relationship-centric CRM / second-brain system that I am first using personally, but may later productize.

This is NOT a generic CRM. It is a system of intelligence and reflection designed to:
- Capture and understand human conversations
- Improve how I listen, serve, and follow up
- Surface patterns, needs, and opportunities over time
- Act as an AI chief of staff and coach for relationship-based work

Use the following operating lenses simultaneously:

1) Bret Victor (HOW to build)
- Make important work visible.
- Show state, change, and consequences clearly.
- Prefer concrete, end-to-end workflows over abstract features.
- Build interactive, inspectable systems where I can see what the AI “thinks.”
- Design for learnability: the UI and feedback should teach me how to work better just by using it.
- Separate domain logic (relationships, conversations, insights) from UI and infrastructure.
- Favor small, composable modules that can evolve.

2) Daniel Ek (WHAT to prioritize)
- Obsess over one core job: helping me build stronger relationships that lead to better outcomes (trust, referrals, deals, long-term value).
- Favor features that compound over time:
  - Relationship memory
  - Conversation intelligence
  - Pattern detection
  - Skill improvement
- Avoid feature sprawl. Every feature must strengthen an existing loop.
- Ship small, testable slices that work end-to-end before expanding.

3) Chetan Puttagunta (HOW to scale later)
- Go slow to go fast.
- Optimize for clarity of value and efficiency, not breadth.
- Design the system so it can:
  - Work as a full CRM for me
  - Later function as an intelligence layer on top of other CRMs
- Sell outcomes, not features, if this is ever productized.

CORE CAPABILITIES ALREADY IN SCOPE:
- Capture every meaningful conversation (calls, meetings, notes, transcripts).
- Household-aware relationship tracking (FORD-based).
- Automate or assist with thoughtful follow-ups, reminders, and service actions.
- Referral intelligence: who could help whom, and why.
- Content intelligence: extract recurring pain points, questions, and themes from conversations.
- AI coaching: help me listen better, ask better questions, and serve needs earlier.
- Weekly reflection rituals (Ninja-aligned) and daily execution support.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO:
1) Propose a feature roadmap organized by “intelligence layers,” not by standard CRM categories.
2) Focus on AI-enabled use cases that emerge naturally from conversation and relationship data.
3) Prioritize features that:
   - Improve decision-making
   - Improve relationship quality
   - Improve my skills (listening, questioning, empathy)
   - Reduce cognitive load
4) Avoid generic CRM features unless they directly support the above.
5) For each proposed feature, explain:
   - What intelligence it uses
   - What outcome it improves
   - Whether it should be fast (daily use) or deep (weekly/monthly reflection)
6) Suggest an order of implementation that makes sense for a solo user now, but does not block future productization.

ASSUME:
- This system replaces Close and other tools for me today.
- Data ownership and trust matter more than growth right now.
- Mobile is primarily for capture; desktop is for thinking and reflection.
- The AI should act like a calm chief of staff and coach, not a nag or dashboard.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Start with a short restatement of the core job this system is doing.
- Then present a phased, AI-enabled feature roadmap (Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3).
- Be opinionated. Recommend what NOT to build as well.
- Keep the focus on compounding intelligence and long-term leverage.
