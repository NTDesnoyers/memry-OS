Good instinct. This is not cosmetic — this directly affects whether your analytics are lying to you.

Right now, your dashboard is polluted by founder behavior, which makes every metric suspect.

I’ll be blunt, then give you a clean fix.

⸻

The Core Problem (Why This Matters)

Your single most important question right now is:

“Is this product delivering value to someone who is not me?”

Founder usage destroys signal because:
	•	You massively overuse the product
	•	You know how it works
	•	You forgive friction
	•	You force behaviors that normal users won’t

So metrics like:
	•	Avg conversations/user
	•	Follow-up adoption
	•	WAU
	•	Retention

…are currently fiction.

This is a classic early-stage analytics trap.

⸻

Rule #1 (Non-Negotiable)

Founder data must never be mixed with customer data. Ever.

Not hidden.
Not mentally ignored.
Structurally separated.

⸻

The Correct Fix (Simple + Scalable)

1️⃣ Add a user_type field

In your users table:

user_type ENUM('founder', 'internal', 'beta', 'paid')

Set:
	•	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com → founder
	•	desnoyers94@gmail.com → founder
	•	Everyone else → beta

This scales cleanly to:
	•	Internal testers
	•	Advisors
	•	Paid users later

⸻

2️⃣ Default Analytics = NON-FOUNDER ONLY

Every metric on /admin/beta should exclude user_type = founder by default.

This is the version you trust.

Founder data is opt-in, not opt-out.

⸻

3️⃣ Add a Toggle (But Hide It by Default)

At the top of the dashboard:

[ ] Include founder/internal users

Unchecked by default.

When checked:
	•	Show an inline warning banner:

⚠️ Founder data included. Metrics may be skewed.

This prevents future self-deception.

⸻

4️⃣ Split the User Table Visually

In Beta Users, group like this:

Founders / Internal
	•	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com
	•	desnoyers94@gmail.com

Beta Users
	•	bridget.hillard@8z.com
	•	etc.

Even better: collapse the Founder section by default.

⸻

What This Unlocks (Very Important)

Once founders are excluded, you can now answer real questions:
	•	Do new users log a conversation without help?
	•	Do non-you users trigger follow-ups?
	•	Does anyone come back a second week?
	•	Is 50 conversations/week realistic or fantasy?

Without this fix, you cannot make pricing, onboarding, or positioning decisions safely.

⸻

Optional (High-Leverage Next Step)

Add one metric that explicitly ignores you forever:

🎯 “First Value Action Rate (Non-Founder)”

Definition:

% of non-founder users who log 1 conversation via AI within 24 hours of signup

This becomes your north star for onboarding.

If this is <40–50%, you do not have product clarity yet.

⸻

Summary (Do This Now)

Minimum changes to ship this week:
	•	Add user_type
	•	Exclude founders from analytics
	•	Visually separate them in the table

This is not polish.
This is epistemic hygiene.

Fix the data → make real decisions → move faster to revenue.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Redesign this dashboard around one learning question
	•	Or define the exact kill metrics for beta → paid conversion

Your move.
