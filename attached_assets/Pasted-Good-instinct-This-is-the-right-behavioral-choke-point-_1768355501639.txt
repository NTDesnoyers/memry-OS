Good instinct. This is the **right behavioral choke point** to gamify.

Right now you’re fixing a *UX tax* (delete junk drafts).
What you want instead is to **reward correct follow-through decisions**, not draft generation.

I’ll break this into 4 parts:

1. **What behavior you are actually trying to gamify**
2. **The correct mental model (don’t call it prompts)**
3. **Concrete gamification mechanics**
4. **What to name it (and what NOT to name it)**

---

## 1️⃣ What behavior are you *actually* trying to gamify

Not:

* Logging conversations ❌
* Generating drafts ❌

Those are **means**, not ends.

You are trying to gamify:

> **Timely, appropriate follow-up decisions based on relationship strength and signal quality**

The “win” is:

* User *recognizes* a follow-up is needed
* Chooses the *right* modality
* Does it *quickly*

So your unit of progress is **decisions**, not drafts.

That’s the key insight.

---

## 2️⃣ The correct mental model (important)

This is NOT:

* A prompt
* A notification
* A reminder

Those imply *passive AI telling you what to do*.

This IS:

> A **judgment checkpoint**

The AI is acting like a good sales manager saying:

> “Hey — based on what just happened, do you want to act on this?”

That framing matters for trust and agency.

## 3️⃣ How to gamify this properly (concrete mechanics)

### 🎯 Core mechanic: **Decision Streaks**

Every suggestion is a **micro-decision**.

Outcomes:

* Text / Email / Note → ✅ *Action Taken*
* Skip → 🚫 *Consciously Skipped*

Both are valid — but they score differently.

#### Example scoring:

* **Action taken**: +1
* **Skipped but justified** (later add optional “why”): +0.5
* **Ignored** (no tap): 0

This reinforces *intentionality*, not blind compliance.

---

### 🔥 “Signal Accuracy” Score (this is powerful)

Later, once you have data:

* If a follow-up leads to:

  * A reply
  * A meeting
  * A deal stage change

Then retroactively:

* AI gets smarter
* User sees:

  > “Your follow-ups after A-contact phone calls convert 2.3× higher than average”

That’s dopamine **and** learning.

---

### 🧠 Cognitive Load Reduction Bonus

Speed matters.

Reward:

* Decisions made within X seconds/minutes
* Fewer skipped suggestions over time

Why?
Fast decisions = habit formation.

---

### 🏁 Weekly Review Tie-In (critical)

In Weekly Review show:

* Suggestions surfaced: 18
* Decisions made: 15
* Actions taken: 11
* Follow-ups completed: 9
* Missed opportunities: 2

Now this feels like a **game you can win**, not a CRM report.

---

## 4️⃣ What to call it (and what NOT to)

### ❌ Do NOT call it:

* Prompts (LLM-y, generic)
* Nudges (soft, therapy-brain)
* Checks (boring)
* Suggestions (passive, low authority)

---

### ✅ Strong naming options (ranked)

#### 🥇 **Follow-Up Signals**

Best overall.

Why it works:

* Sounds intelligent
* Implies judgment, not instruction
* Fits Ninja Selling language
* Scales well (“high-signal week”, “missed signals”)

UI copy:

> **Follow-Up Signal**
> Phone call + A-contact + new job mentioned
> How do you want to follow up?

---

#### 🥈 **Action Signals**

More general, future-proof.

Good if you later expand beyond follow-ups.

---

#### 🥉 **Conversation Signals**

Good, but slightly wordier.

---

### My recommendation (clear):

**Call it: *Follow-Up Signals***

And the action is:

> “Resolve signal”

That single verb is doing a LOT of work.

---

## Final ruthless takeaway

You’re not building:

* An AI that writes messages

You’re building:

* A **decision engine that trains sales instincts**

Gamify:

* Decisions
* Speed
* Accuracy over time

Do that, and this stops being “a smarter CRM”
and becomes **a performance system people don’t want to break**.

If you want, next we can:

* Design the exact scoring formula
* Decide what *not* to score (important)
* Or write the in-app microcopy for this flow word-for-word
