Good list. Now I’m going to **collapse this into what actually matters for behavior + learning** and kill the rest (for now).

I’ll go item by item, then give you a **clear MVP decision set** and a **V1 → V2 roadmap**.

---

## The core question (frame everything through this)

> Does this increase:
>
> 1. Correct follow-up decisions
> 2. Speed to decision
> 3. Learning signal quality

If it doesn’t improve at least **one** of those, it’s noise.

---

## 1️⃣ Signal expiration

**This matters. A lot.**

### Decision: ✅ YES, signals should expire

But **silently**, not punitively.

**Why:**

* Signals stacking forever = cognitive debt
* You’re training avoidance, not habits
* Real sales reality: follow-up windows decay

### MVP behavior:

* Signal auto-expires after **7 days**
* Status becomes: **Expired**
* Counts as:

  * Neutral for streaks
  * Negative for “missed opportunity” stats (weekly review only)

### UI copy:

> “Signal expired — follow-up window likely passed”

No guilt. Just reality.

**Do NOT surface expired signals in the main flow.**
Only surface them in weekly review.

✅ Keep.

---

## 2️⃣ Multiple signals per interaction

**This matters, but bundling is dangerous.**

### Decision: ❌ Do NOT bundle

### Decision: ✅ One signal per person

**Why:**

* The *decision unit* is the person
* Bundles increase friction and hesitation
* You want fast taps, not deliberation

If a conversation mentions:

* Sarah (new job)
* Mike (needs intro)
* Jen (birthday next week)

That’s **3 signals**.

Each resolved independently.
Each trains judgment.

✅ Keep separate.

---

## 3️⃣ Skip reasons

This is a **trap if done wrong**.

### Decision: ❌ NO skip reasons in MVP

### Decision: ✅ Add later *only if* optional + fast

**Why:**

* Forced justification kills speed
* Early users will lie or tap random options
* You don’t yet know which reasons matter

### MVP:

* Skip = logged as “Consciously skipped”
* Zero friction

### V2 (optional):

* After tapping Skip, show:

  > “Want to say why?”
  > (optional, dismissible)

Reasons (only 3):

* Already handled
* Not important
* Will do later

But this is **not MVP-critical**.

---

## 4️⃣ Undo capability

This is about **trust**, not gamification.

### Decision: ✅ YES, but minimal

**Why:**

* People mis-tap
* Fear of irreversible actions slows decisions
* Undo increases confidence → faster taps

### MVP behavior:

* After resolving a signal, show a **5–10 second undo toast**
* After that, it’s final

Do NOT allow undo days later.
That encourages second-guessing.

---

## 5️⃣ Signal priority

This is **critical**, but mostly invisible.

### Decision: ✅ YES, rank signals

### Decision: ❌ Do NOT show numeric priority yet

**Why:**

* Users don’t need to see the math
* They *do* need the ordering to feel right

### MVP priority logic (simple, deterministic):

Rank by:

1. A/B/C/D contact segment
2. Life event detected
3. Days since last contact
4. Interaction type (call > meeting > text)

Then surface:

* Top 1–3 signals
* Everything else behind “More”

Later you can expose labels like:

* “High signal”
* “Low signal”

But not now.

---

## 6️⃣ Notification strategy

This is where most apps screw themselves.

### Decision: ❌ NO push notifications in MVP

### Decision: ❌ NO interruptive reminders

### Decision: ✅ Passive visibility only

**Why:**

* Push notifications before habit = churn
* You haven’t earned interruption rights yet
* Signals should feel like *support*, not nagging

### MVP:

* Badge count in nav (small, subtle)
* Signals visible when app opens
* That’s it

### V2+:

* Optional daily digest
* Never real-time pings

---

## 7️⃣ Existing drafts page

This is mostly a naming + mental model issue.

### Decision: ✅ KEEP drafts

### Decision: ❌ Do NOT merge with signals

### Decision: ✅ Rename for clarity

**Why:**

* Signals = decisions
* Drafts = artifacts
* Mixing them confuses cause vs effect

### Recommended rename:

* “Drafts” → **Prepared Follow-Ups**
  or
* “Queued Messages”

Signals create drafts.
Drafts are downstream.

Keep that separation clean.

---

## 🔥 What matters MOST (priority order)

If you had to ship only 4 things correctly, it’s these:

### 1️⃣ Signal expiration

Prevents cognitive rot.

### 2️⃣ One signal per person

Preserves clean decision units.

### 3️⃣ Priority ordering (even if hidden)

Makes the system feel “smart.”

### 4️⃣ Undo (short window)

Builds trust and speed.

Everything else is secondary.

---

## Final MVP signal contract (copy this)

**A Follow-Up Signal:**

* Is created per person
* Surfaces immediately after interaction
* Is ranked automatically
* Expires after 7 days
* Requires a single tap to resolve
* Produces a draft *only after approval*
* Can be undone briefly
* Never nags

That’s a **behavior-shaping system**, not a feature pile.

If you want next:

* I can write the **exact data model**
* Or the **in-app copy for every state**
* Or help you decide what metrics to expose vs hide

Pick one.
