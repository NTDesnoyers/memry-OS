You are analyzing an in‑progress B2B SaaS product: an “AI chief of staff / relationship OS for real estate agents.”  
You must act like a brutally honest product strategist with Alex Hormozi’s mindset: prioritize revenue, adoption, and speed over elegance or feature count.[1][2]

Your tasks:

1. **Scan and summarize the product as it exists now**  
   Using whatever information you can infer from the current repository (code, comments, docs, filenames, routes, components, config, etc.), produce a concise but complete picture of the product in its current state.  
   Organize your output as:

   **A. Problem, User, Outcome (your best inference)**  
   - Core problem this product appears to solve (1–2 sentences).  
   - Target user description (3–5 bullets: role, behavior, production level, niche, geography if obvious).  
   - Implied “dream outcome” for that user if this product works perfectly (1–2 sentences).[3][4]

   **B. Feature and Workflow List (current + clearly implied)**  
   Create a table or structured list where each row is one feature or workflow you can infer from the codebase. For each, include:  
   - Feature name.  
   - Brief description of what it does.  
   - Type: {Core workflow, Support/utility, Analytics/reporting, Integration, “Nice to have”}.  
   - Likely primary user outcome: {time saved, more revenue / more deals, fewer dropped balls, better visibility, less stress, etc.}.  
   - Status: {Implemented, Partially implemented, Stubbed/empty shell, Planned/implied}.  
   - Your assessment of importance for MVP: {Must‑have, Should‑have, Could‑have, Not for MVP}.[5][3]

   Focus on things that are visible in the code: core flows, models, routes, background jobs, agents, integrations, UI modules, etc. If something is ambiguous, label it as such rather than pretending certainty.[6][7]

   **C. Key objects and data model**  
   - List the main domain objects/entities (e.g., Agent, Contact, Conversation, Task, Deal, Note, AI Agent, etc.).  
   - For each, briefly describe its role in the system and any relationships that seem central to how value is delivered.  
   This is just enough detail so another AI can reason about workflows and user value.[8][6]

2. **Apply ruthless prioritization (Hormozi lens)**  

   Using your best judgment, and ignoring sunk cost in the code:

   **D. Non‑negotiable MVP**  
   Identify the **3–7 features/workflows** that are absolutely required for a realtor to get an “aha” moment and realistically pay 49–79 dollars/month as a Founding Agent.  
   For each, explain in one sentence how it directly contributes to a measurable outcome (more deals, more referrals, less time wasted, fewer dropped balls).[3][8]

   **E. Cut / delay list**  
   Identify features that look like distractions for a first revenue‑focused MVP:  
   - Things that are complex but don’t obviously drive deals, referrals, or daily time savings.  
   - Things that look like “platform” or “OS” ideas that can wait until after 10–20 paying users.  
   For each, briefly justify why it should be cut or delayed (“no clear impact on revenue,” “helps only edge cases,” “heavy effort for small perceived value,” etc.).[9][10][3]

   **F. Quick‑win improvements**  
   Propose 3–5 **specific, low‑effort changes** that would likely increase perceived value or make it easier to sell and onboard (e.g., one streamlined onboarding path, one killer dashboard, clearer daily brief, a single integration that unlocks more utility, etc.).[11][3]

3. **Generate better questions for the founder to ask**  

   Output a short section called:

   **G. Better questions to ask next**

   Give 5–10 sharp, uncomfortable questions the founder should answer before building more features.  
   These questions should aim at:  
   - Clarifying the core promise and ICP.  
   - Forcing trade‑offs between building and selling.  
   - Exposing features that are ego or novelty rather than revenue.[4][12][13]

   Examples of the style (adapt, don’t repeat verbatim):  
   - “If I had to close 10 agents at 79 dollars/month using what exists today, what exact workflow would I demo and why?”  
   - “Which features, if removed, would NOT cause any current user (including me) to cancel?”  
   - “What is the one promise I can make that is both true and compelling enough to get a busy agent’s attention?”[2][14][1]

Constraints for your response:  
- Be blunt, concise, and practical.  
- Do not sugarcoat; if the product looks scattered or overbuilt for its stage, say so explicitly.  
- Assume this analysis will be pasted into another AI for further ruthless critique and MVP scoping.
