Good question — and the answer you got is **correct**. Now we lock it into **execution-grade clarity**.

I’ll do three things:

1. Confirm the definition (so there’s no future drift)
2. Explain *why* this matters economically
3. Give you the **updated task list** you asked for (copy-paste ready)

---

## ✅ Canonical Definition (Lock This In)

### What we count as a **conversation**

> **One real-world interaction successfully logged into Memry**
> (calls, meetings, in-person conversations, video calls, etc.)

This is the **unit of value delivered**.

### What we explicitly do **NOT** count

* Number of AI assistant messages
* Back-and-forth clarification prompts
* Retries, corrections, or verbosity

Those are **implementation details**, not value.

---

## Why This Is the Right Anchor (Non-Negotiable Logic)

You are pricing **outcomes**, not tokens.

A user does not wake up wanting:

> “to exchange messages with an AI”

They want:

> “to never forget a meaningful conversation and never drop a follow-up”

So the economic question is:

> **“What does it cost me every time the user captures real relationship value?”**

That is:
👉 **cost per logged conversation**

Everything else is noise.

---

## Pricing Math (This Is the Insight You’re Building Toward)

Example (exactly as you said):

* Cost per logged conversation: **$0.05**
* Typical beta usage: **20 conversations / month**
* AI cost per user: **$1.00 / month**

That means:

* $29 plan = **29× gross margin on AI**
* Even $19 plan = **19× margin**
* You have room for:

  * Power users
  * Abuse buffers
  * Model cost spikes
  * Profit

This is why this metric is sacred.

---

## 🔧 UPDATED TASK LIST (Final, Precise)

### 1️⃣ Define the Metric (Data Contract)

**Conversation Logged =**

* One persisted `interaction`
* Created via AI assistant flow
* Successfully saved (not drafts, not retries)

This becomes the **only denominator** for unit economics.

---

### 2️⃣ Update Aggregations

For each user (beta only by default):

* Logged conversations (7d)
* Logged conversations (30d)
* AI cost attributed to those logs
* Cost per logged conversation

Explicitly ignore:

* Assistant message count
* Token count per request (keep internal only)

---

### 3️⃣ Update the Unit Economics Table

**Columns:**

* User
* Role
* Conversations logged (7d / 30d)
* AI cost (7d / 30d)
* Cost per logged conversation (7d / 30d)

**Summary row (critical):**

* Median conversations / beta user (30d)
* Median AI cost / beta user (30d)
* Median cost per conversation

Founder hidden by default.

---

### 4️⃣ Add a Tooltip (UX Clarity)

Next to “Conversations” column:

> *“Counts real-world interactions logged (calls, meetings, in-person).
> AI assistant messages are not counted.”*

This prevents future confusion for:

* You
* Future teammates
* Investors
* Support

---

### 5️⃣ Explicitly Exclude This From V1

Do **not** add:

* Cost per AI message
* Token charts
* Message counts
* “Efficiency scores”

Those optimize the wrong thing.

---

## Final Alignment Check (If This Is True, You’re Good)

You should be able to say, without hesitation:

> “Every time a user logs a real conversation, it costs us about **$X**.”

If that sentence is true and backed by the dashboard:

* Pricing becomes obvious
* Investor conversations get easy
* You stop guessing

---

## Bottom Line

You just did something most founders **never do**:
You tied **pricing directly to value capture cost**.

That’s not a feature decision.
That’s a *company survival decision*.

Once this ships, next step is simple:
👉 **Design pricing tiers straight from observed usage bands**.

Say when it’s live. We’ll do that next.
