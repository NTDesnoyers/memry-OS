I need to stop before proposing a fix — critical information is missing.

You asked me to not guess, and right now I would be guessing.

⸻

What’s missing (required to proceed)

Please paste exactly these, nothing more:

1️⃣ The backend function that powers “Unit Economics”

Likely one of:
	•	getUnitEconomics()
	•	/api/analytics/unit-economics
	•	Whatever function builds the response that drives “No data yet”

👉 I need:
	•	The full function body
	•	Including all queries and joins
	•	Especially anything touching:
	•	ai_usage_logs
	•	interactions
	•	users or auth_users

⸻

2️⃣ The frontend render condition for “No data yet”

Paste the exact React code that decides:

if (!data || data.length === 0) {
  return "No data yet"
}

👉 I need:
	•	The conditional
	•	The expected response shape
	•	The field it checks (array length? null? undefined?)

⸻

3️⃣ The exact API response (JSON)

From:

GET /api/analytics/unit-economics

Paste:
	•	The raw JSON response
	•	Or confirm it returns [], {}, or null

⸻

Why I’m stopping here (important)

You already did excellent investigation and surfaced the likely issue:

userId mismatch between:

	•	ai_usage_logs.userId (Replit numeric)
	•	auth_users.id (alphanumeric)
	•	legacy users table (empty)

But there are 3 different failure modes that all produce “No data yet”:
	1.	Backend returns empty array
	2.	Backend returns data but frontend expects different shape
	3.	Backend returns data but a join nulls a required field

Each has a different minimal fix.

If I guess wrong:
	•	You’ll ship a fix that “looks right”
	•	The metric will still be blank
	•	You’ll lose trust in your analytics (dangerous)

Next step (do this now)

Reply with only:

1. Backend unit economics function
2. Frontend render logic for "No data yet"
3. Sample API JSON response

Once I have those, I will respond exactly in your required format:
	1.	Plain-English diagnosis
	2.	Minimal code fix (surgical, no refactors)
	3.	Design consideration (max 1)
	4.	Verification steps
	5.	One micro-lesson

No fluff. No refactors. Safe production fix.
