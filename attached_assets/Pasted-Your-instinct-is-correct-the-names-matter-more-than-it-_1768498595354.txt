Your instinct is correct — **the names matter more than it seems**, because names encode behavior.

Right now:

* **“Beta”** implies temporary, incomplete, waiting for permission
* **“Founder”** implies indulgence, tinkering, personal playground

Both subtly invite the *wrong* behavior from future-you and collaborators.

What you actually have is:

* A **production product**
* An **internal R&D surface**

Those need names that **enforce discipline**, not nostalgia.

---

## The Right Mental Model (Lock This In)

You are not running:

* Beta vs Founder

You are running:

* **Product** vs **Lab**

One makes money.
One preserves optionality.

Everything else flows from that.

---

## Recommended Rename (Strong Opinion)

### ✅ Primary App: **Memry**

No modifier. No apology.

This communicates:

* This is the product
* This is what users buy
* This is what metrics matter for

Navigation label:

> **Memry**

Scope:

* Flow
* Signals
* Actions
* Weekly Review
* Contacts

---

### ✅ Secondary Area: **Internal Lab**

Not “Founder Mode.”
Not “Ideas.”
Not “Experiments.”

**Internal Lab** signals:

* Non-user-facing
* Non-committal
* Allowed to be messy
* Explicitly not stable

Navigation label (founder-only):

> **Internal Lab**

Subtext (optional, founder-only UI hint):

> “Hypotheses & infrastructure. Not part of the product.”

This instantly reframes behavior:

* You stop polishing Lab features
* You stop feeling guilty about unfinished ideas
* You stop mentally counting them as “work owed”

---

## Why This Rename Is Strategically Important

### 1. It Prevents Scope Creep by Language Alone

You don’t need willpower.
You’ve embedded the rule in the UI.

No one asks:

> “Should this go in Memry or the Lab?”

The answer becomes obvious.

---

### 2. It Protects Monetization Focus

You can now say — truthfully:

> “If it’s not in Memry, it doesn’t affect revenue.”

That’s a Hormozi-grade filter.

---

### 3. It Makes Deletion Easier Later

When the time comes to kill something in the Lab:

* No sunk-cost guilt
* No “but users might want it”
* No architectural panic

It was never promised.

---

## What I Would Do Next (Exact Order)

### Step 1 — Rename in UI + Code

* Rename “Beta” → **Memry**
* Rename “Founder” → **Internal Lab**
* Keep access founder-only

No refactors yet. Just naming.

---

### Step 2 — Update `replit.md` (Yes, Do This Now)

Add this section verbatim (you can copy-paste):

```md
## Product Scope Discipline

Memry operates with two explicit scopes:

### Memry (The Product)
This is the sellable, user-facing product.
Only features that directly improve conversation logging, follow-up execution, or review consistency belong here.

Current scope:
- Flow
- Signals
- Actions
- Weekly Review
- Contacts

### Internal Lab (Founder-Only)
This area contains hypotheses, partial implementations, and infrastructure.
Nothing in the Internal Lab is user-facing or guaranteed to ship.

Rules:
- No Lab feature receives polish or onboarding
- No Lab feature graduates without a defined experiment
- Graduation requires measurable impact on Memry core behaviors
```

This is **operating law**.

---

### Step 3 — Light Audit (Not a Refactor)

Ask Replit to:

* Confirm no Internal Lab routes/components are imported by Memry routes
* Flag any shared state or queries crossing boundaries

This is a **leak check**, not cleanup.

---

## What NOT to Do (Important)

* ❌ Do NOT delete Lab features yet
* ❌ Do NOT refactor Lab UI
* ❌ Do NOT move Lab features “just in case”
* ❌ Do NOT rename things to “v2”, “future”, or “advanced”

Those names invite premature promotion.

---

## Bottom Line

Renaming isn’t cosmetic here.
It’s **organizational control**.

You’re transitioning from:

> “I can build anything”

to:

> “I choose what deserves existence”

That’s the shift from builder → founder.

### Priority recommendation:

1. Rename Beta → Memry
2. Rename Founder → Internal Lab
3. Update `replit.md`
4. Run a leakage audit

If you want, next we can:

* Design the **first Lab → Memry graduation test**
* Or aggressively simplify Memry UX for activation
* Or map a **$29 → $99 expansion path** without adding features

Say the word.
