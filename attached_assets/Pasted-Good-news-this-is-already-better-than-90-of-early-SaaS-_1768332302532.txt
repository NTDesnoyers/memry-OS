Good news: this is **already better than 90% of early SaaS landing pages**.

Bad news (and where the money is): it’s still **too polite, too generic, and not sharp enough to force action**, especially for a *free beta*.

I’m going to do this **Hormozi × Lean** style:

1. Diagnose what’s weak
2. Rewrite key sections (copy-level, not design)
3. Show you **exact changes** to increase conversion *now*
4. Align it with **free beta reality** (your current constraint)

No fluff.

## 1️⃣ THE CORE PROBLEM WITH THE PAGE

### Right now, your page answers:

> “What is this?”

But it does **not** aggressively answer:

> “Why should I stop what I’m doing and sign up *right now*?”

Your ICP (relationship-based agents) already:

* Knows follow-up matters
* Knows CRMs suck
* Believes they’re “pretty good” at staying in touch

So generic statements like:

> “Stop losing deals because you forget to follow up”

are **true but not emotionally expensive enough**.

Agents don’t feel the pain as “forgetting.”
They feel it as:

* “I *meant* to follow up”
* “That deal went cold”
* “They went with another agent”
* “I’m embarrassed it’s been too long to reach out”

We need to **name that pain explicitly**.

---

## 2️⃣ HERO SECTION: MAKE IT SHARPER & MORE COSTLY

### CURRENT HEADLINE

> Stop Losing Deals Because You Forget to Follow Up

❌ Too soft
❌ Sounds like a productivity app
❌ Doesn’t call out *agents specifically*

### REWRITE (CHOOSE ONE)

**Option A (Loss-Framed, High Pain):**

> Deals don’t fall apart.
> They fade when you don’t follow up.

**Option B (Agent-Specific, Ego Hit):**

> You’re not bad at real estate.
> You’re bad at remembering who to follow up with.

**Option C (My Favorite – Direct & Concrete):**

> You didn’t lose that deal.
> You just forgot to follow up.

---

### SUBHEAD (CURRENT)

> Memry remembers your conversations, shows you who needs your attention today, and drafts your follow-ups so nothing slips through the cracks.

❌ Feature-heavy
❌ Reads like documentation
❌ No outcome

### SUBHEAD (REWRITE)

> Memry is a relationship-first CRM that remembers every conversation, tells you exactly who to contact next, and drafts the follow-up **in your voice**—so deals don’t go cold.

Key change:

* Outcome first
* “In your voice” emphasized
* “Relationship-first CRM” positions against incumbents

---

### CTA (CRITICAL)

Right now:

> Apply for the Founding Agent Beta

This is fine, but **free beta ≠ application energy**.

If it’s free, the CTA should feel:

* Low risk
* Fast
* Slightly exclusive

#### RECOMMENDED:

> Join the Free Founding Agent Beta →

And under it:

> Limited spots · Built with real agent workflows

---

## 3️⃣ AUDIENCE QUALIFICATION: PUSH HARDER

This section is good, but too gentle.

### CURRENT

> For relationship-based real estate agents who:
> • Talk to a lot of people every week
> • Rely on referrals and repeat business
> • Hate updating CRMs
> • Know follow-up makes money — but struggle to stay consistent

### REWRITE (MORE DISQUALIFYING)

> Memry is for relationship-based agents who:
> • Talk to people all day—and forget half of it by tomorrow
> • Live on referrals, not cold leads
> • Hate “updating the CRM” after a long day
> • Know follow-up makes money—but still let it slide

This does two things:

* Makes the reader say “that’s me”
* Makes non-ICP bounce (good)

---

## 4️⃣ “WHAT YOU GET” → SHIFT FROM FEATURES TO WINS

Your features are solid. The framing isn’t.

### CURRENT CARD: Conversation Capture

> Log calls, meetings, and notes in seconds…

### REWRITE:

**Conversation Capture**

> Dump conversations in seconds—voice or text—and never wonder *“what did we talk about?”* again.

---

### AI Follow-Ups

> Drafts thank-you emails, check-ins, and next steps…

🔧 Add **stakes**:

**AI Follow-Ups**

> Get follow-ups drafted from real conversations—so reaching out never feels awkward or late.

---

### Relationship CRM

> FORD notes + A/B/C/D segments…

Agents don’t care about segmentation. They care about *who to call today*.

**Relationship CRM**

> Always know who matters most, who’s going cold, and who you should contact today.

---

## 5️⃣ “HOW MEMRY WORKS” – GOOD, JUST TIGHTEN

This section is strong conceptually. Just sharpen language.

### STEP 1

> Log a conversation
> Talk or type naturally — no formatting required.

✅ Good
🔧 Minor tweak:

> Log a conversation
> Talk or type naturally—no forms, no cleanup.

---

### STEP 2

> Memry extracts what matters

Add clarity:

> Memry extracts what matters
> People, topics, follow-ups, and FORD insights—automatically.

---

### STEP 3

> Get the right follow-up instantly

Make it outcome-driven:

> Get the right follow-up instantly
> Know who to contact next and exactly what to say.

---

## 6️⃣ “WHY AGENTS SWITCH” – ADD CONTRAST

This is where you should **subtly attack CRMs**.

### CURRENT BULLETS (GOOD, BUT SAFE)

### REWRITE (STRONGER):

> • Built for relationships—not data entry
> • Designed around memory, not pipelines
> • Matches how agents actually work day-to-day
> • Feels like a second brain, not another system to maintain

This positions Memry as a **category shift**, not a feature upgrade.

---

## 7️⃣ PRICING SECTION: FIX THE CONTRADICTION

You said:

> “I’m currently running the free beta”

But the page says:

> $29/month during beta

❌ This creates friction and distrust.

### IF THE BETA IS FREE:

Change to:

**Founding Agent Beta**

> Free for early users
> Paid plans coming later

Bullets:

* Limited number of early users
* Direct access to the founder
* Help shape what gets built next
* Early-user perks when pricing launches

CTA:

> Join the Free Founding Agent Beta →

---

### IF YOU WANT A PAID BETA LATER:

Add a **price anchor**, not a charge:

> Future price: $29/month
> Free for founding beta users

This preserves pricing power without blocking signups.

---

## 8️⃣ ONE MISSING SECTION (HIGH LEVERAGE)

You are missing **social proof / founder credibility**, even lightweight.

Add **one short section**:

### Example:

> Built by a relationship-based agent
> Memry was built out of daily frustration with CRMs that don’t match how real agents work.

Or even:

> “I built Memry because I was tired of knowing I *should* follow up—and still not doing it.”

This humanizes and increases trust massively in a beta.

---

## 9️⃣ SUMMARY: WHAT TO FIX FIRST (ORDERED)

If you only do **5 things**, do these:

1. Rewrite the **headline** to be sharper and more costly
2. Change CTA to **Join the Free Founding Agent Beta**
3. Remove pricing friction if beta is free
4. Add stronger pain language around *awkward, late follow-ups*
5. Add light founder credibility

---

## FINAL TRUTH (NO SUGARCOATING)

You don’t have a traffic problem.
You don’t have a feature problem.

You have a **“this feels nice, not urgent” problem**.

Fix the language to:

* Increase perceived loss
* Increase specificity
* Reduce friction

Do that, and this page will convert **far better**, even with the same product.

If you want next:

* I can rewrite this **line-by-line copy** in final form
* Or help you **A/B test 2 hero sections**
* Or tighten it for a **paid beta transition**

Your move.
