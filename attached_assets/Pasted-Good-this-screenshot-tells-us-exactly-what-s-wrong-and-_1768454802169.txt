Good — this screenshot tells us exactly what’s wrong, and it’s not subtle.

I’m going to be blunt because this is important:

👉 This is not an admin dashboard. This is a metrics postcard.
It answers zero operational questions.

You’re feeling “I can’t see who is a beta user” because the dashboard is optimized for vanity metrics before identity, which is backwards for a beta.

Let’s fix that.

⸻

The Core Problem (Why This Feels Useless)

Right now, the dashboard tells you:
	•	Totals
	•	Averages
	•	Percentages

But it does not tell you:
	•	Who signed up
	•	Who logged in
	•	Who activated
	•	Who is stuck
	•	Who failed auth
	•	Who to email or DM

For a beta, identity > aggregates.

Until you have PMF, your admin view should feel like:

“I know exactly what every user is doing.”

Right now it feels like:

“Something might be happening?”

That’s unacceptable.

⸻

What’s Missing (Non-Negotiable)

You need one new section, above everything else:

🔥 “Beta Users” Table (v0)

This alone fixes 80% of your pain.

⸻

Exact Spec: Beta Users Table (Must Add)

Add a section at the top of /admin/beta.

Columns (exact)

Column	Why it matters
Email	Primary identifier
Status	invited / signed_up / activated
Last Seen	Are they alive?
Conversations	Are they getting value?
Follow-ups	Are they using leverage?
Signup Date	Cohort awareness

Example row:

jane@exprealty.com | activated | 2 days ago | 7 | 3 | Jan 12

That one row tells you more than your entire current dashboard.

⸻

How to Compute Status (Simple Rules)

Do not overthink this.
	•	invited
→ In beta_whitelist
→ No user_signup event
	•	signed_up
→ Has user_signup
→ No activated
	•	activated
→ Has activated event

This is deterministic. No guesses.

⸻

Why Your Current Metrics Are Lying (Important)

Right now:
	•	Weekly Active = 0
	•	Avg Conversations = 0
	•	Engagement = 0%

This might mean:
	•	No one used it

OR it might mean:
	•	Events aren’t wired yet
	•	Activation logic just landed
	•	You’re the only user and filtered out
	•	Time window mismatch

Without seeing users, you cannot debug metrics.

Metrics come after identity.

⸻

What to Remove or Deprioritize (For Now)

You can keep these, but they should be secondary:
	•	WAU Rate
	•	Week-over-week retention
	•	Avg conversations/user
	•	Weekly goal progress

These matter after you have 20–30 activated users.

Right now they create false anxiety or false confidence.

⸻

Minimal Implementation Path (Fast)

You already have everything you need:
	•	auth_users
	•	beta_events
	•	conversations
	•	followups

You do not need:
	•	New tracking
	•	New infra
	•	New permissions

Just a server query + a table.

If this takes more than ~1 hour, you’re overengineering.

⸻

Founder Operating Rule (Lock This In)

Until PMF:

You should recognize every email in the beta user table.
If you don’t, you’re not close enough to the product.

This table becomes your:
	•	Outreach list
	•	Debug queue
	•	Retention weapon

⸻

Final Directive

Add the Beta Users table.
Put it above the metrics.
Ship it.
Republish.

Then come back with:
	•	A screenshot of the table
	•	What surprised you about who’s activated vs not

That’s when we decide what to fix in the product itself.
