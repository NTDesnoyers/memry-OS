2026-01-14T15:22:40.459Z	suggestion	So far the signals are working well. However there needs to be perhaps an action signal as well. The follow-up is not always just text, call, email, Android notes, etc. It is also added social media or maybe something else that is outside of these communication realms. For example I want to find an ad or a post on social media and I need a way to track that and make sure it gets added to the context graphs etc.	/signals	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			f71a43fc-c913-4f9f-af69-94cc071b1abf

2026-01-14T15:39:54.117Z	bug	Last night I was at bowling and I had a conversation with Dominic Jackson, Jiunwei Shyy, Dara Keat. Really didn't learn much new. Also spoke with Jerry Pena, his friend made an app called The BARTR and Jerry is in healthcare human resources as a career. 4 actions taken I found multiple matches for Dominic Jackson and Dara Keat, as well as Jiunwei Shyy. No results came up for Jerry Pena. Here's the breakdown: - Dominic Jackson: Two matches found. Both are in segment A. - Jiunwei Shyy: Found one match in segment D, last contacted on Jan 10, 2026. - Dara Keat: Multiple matches found, including one in segment A - Advocate and another in segment D. One record has a slightly different spelling (Dara Keet). - Jerry Pena: Not found in the database. Do you want me to process all of these and create a new contact for Jerry Pena? Let me know if any names need clarification or adjustments. gpt-4o • Tool calling or complex reasoning yes, and combine the duplicates.  Dara's last name is correctly spelled Keat. this thread caused a convo to be logged as 1/12.  last night was 1/13	/	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			cb25d0c5-a888-4a92-b3e9-3b6ba358540d																		
2026-01-14T15:48:34.578Z	bug	I had the AI Chat correct the date of these interactions and it put them through again to do follow-ups. We need to create some logic where this doesn't happen again because this could be annoying. Although ideally it gets the date the first time.	/signals	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			18567017-65ba-4201-9708-8df84d0e9ffa																		
2026-01-14T15:49:39.827Z	bug	When I click "skip" on a signal, and then I click someone else to skip. I just think we need to change the skipping thing where maybe I skip and instead of it taking 10 seconds to disappear, there's an option to do it quickly. I don't know let's brainstorm this.	/signals	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			5b8c8792-3e5d-4faa-b5c8-73e48d5014b9																		
2026-01-14T15:55:45.592Z	suggestion	In Carlos's conversation I mentioned the need to connect him with my client Matt Smalley. We need to figure out a way to have actions that involve introductions and group chats connected to both people. I think what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna click "Text" and then put that text in there, but we'll see.	/signals	nathan@desnoyersproperties.com	beta	New			5dc7f6ca-cd4b-412f-8a47-eecbec30775c
