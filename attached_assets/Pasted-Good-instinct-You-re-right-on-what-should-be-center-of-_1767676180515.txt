Good instinct. You’re right on what should be center-of-gravity.
But we need to be precise so you don’t accidentally turn this into a notes app instead of a behavior-changing system.

I’m going to agree with you, then tighten it so it doesn’t break the Lean test.

⸻

First: You’re Right About the Core Action

For the beta, the atomic behavior you are testing is:

“Did the agent have a real conversation, and did Flow capture it?”

That is the smallest unit of value.

Not follow-ups.
Not dashboards.
Not analytics.

So yes:

✅ Flow (Conversations) should be the default landing page

Because:
	•	That’s the new behavior you’re asking them to adopt
	•	It’s where differentiation lives
	•	It’s what creates future leverage (AI memory, follow-ups, insights)

If they don’t log conversations, everything else is fake value.

⸻

But Here’s the Trap (Pay Attention)

If Flow = Home without structure, you get:
	•	Long unstructured dumps
	•	Inconsistent usage
	•	Cognitive fatigue
	•	“I’ll log it later”
	•	Beta users who like the idea but don’t build habit

That’s Day One CRM failure mode.

So we need Flow as Home, but Flow as a guided action, not a blank page.

⸻

Correct Mental Model (This Matters)

Think of Flow OS in beta as:

A conversation capture machine with memory.

NOT:
	•	A task manager
	•	A CRM
	•	A dashboard

The primary CTA of the product should be:

“Log the conversation you just had.”

Everything else exists to support or reward that action.

⸻

Recommended Navigation (Beta)

Here’s the clean structure I’d ship:

🧭 Navigation (Beta)
	1.	Flow ← DEFAULT / HOME
(Conversation capture)
	2.	Today
(Who to follow up with today — execution)
	3.	Weekly Review
(Reflection + prioritization)
	4.	Contacts
(Reference, not daily use)
	5.	Drafts
(AI output waiting for approval)

⚠️ Revival disappears as a top-level item.

⸻

What Flow (Home) Should Feel Like

Flow should feel like:

“I just hung up. I open Flow. I dump what happened. I’m done.”

Flow Page Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
	1.	Single Primary CTA
	•	“Log a Conversation”
	2.	Guided Capture (FORD-first)
	•	Family
	•	Occupation
	•	Recreation
	•	Dreams
	•	(Optional freeform)
	3.	Person Resolution
	•	“Who was this with?”
	•	Smart suggestions
	•	Fast selection
	4.	Time Awareness
	•	Auto-timestamped
	•	“Counts toward this week’s goal”
	5.	Instant Reward
	•	“Here’s the follow-up draft”
	•	Or “Here’s what Flow remembered last time”

If Flow doesn’t feel fast + relieving, users won’t log.

⸻

Lean Startup Framing (This is Key)

Your Beta MVP Hypothesis becomes:

“If agents can capture conversations in under 60 seconds, they will do it consistently.”

That’s testable.
That’s falsifiable.
That’s correct for Lean.

Your Success Metric (Beta)
	•	% of conversations logged within 15 minutes of ending
	•	Average time to log
	•	% of logs that result in a sent follow-up

Not:
	•	Number of contacts
	•	Number of notes
	•	Time spent in app

⸻

How Weekly Review Fits (Without Competing)

Weekly Review is downstream.

Flow feeds it.

Weekly Review exists to answer:

“Did you capture enough signal this week to stay in control?”

If Flow is Home and Weekly Review is a ritual, they reinforce each other.

⸻

Final Call (Clarity)

You’re right:
	•	Flow should be the main page
	•	Conversation capture is the beta’s wedge
	•	This is FORD & Record, not CRM v2

But:
	•	Flow must be guided, not open-ended
	•	Weekly Review is still required for habit + retention
	•	Today becomes execution, not thinking

⸻

Next Decision (Pick One)

I can:
	1.	Design the Flow capture UX step-by-step (copy + structure)
	2.	Define the exact beta success metrics + kill criteria
	3.	Refine Today so it feels like “do these 3 things and you’re done”

Say the number.
