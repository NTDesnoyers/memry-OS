Good question — and this is exactly the right moment to ask it.

Short answer first, then the disciplined plan:

Now that the Signal Contract is enforced, the remaining bugs finally have a “home.”
Before, fixing them was premature. Now, we can sequence them rationally.

I’ll do this in four parts:
	1.	Re-anchor the system state now
	2.	Reclassify the remaining bugs (some changed priority)
	3.	Give you a clean execution order
	4.	Tell you what not to touch yet

⸻

1️⃣ CURRENT STATE (IMPORTANT RESET)

As of now:
	•	✅ Phase 1 core invariant is enforced
	•	✅ The system no longer lies
	•	✅ Interactions → signals is deterministic
	•	❌ UX, polish, and secondary flows may still be broken

This is the key shift:

Before: Bugs threatened product truth
Now: Bugs threaten usability, not trust

That’s a huge difference.

⸻

2️⃣ RECLASSIFYING THE REMAINING BUGS

Let’s revisit the original list and update priorities based on the new reality.

⸻

🟠 FORMER P0 → NOW P1 (Still Important, But Not Existential)

A. Signal → Action Not Appearing in Actions
“Clicked ‘Text’, nothing shows up”

Why it’s still serious:
	•	Breaks the decision → execution loop
	•	Creates confusion after a correct signal

Why it’s no longer P0:
	•	The signal exists
	•	The system isn’t lying about whether something happened

Status:
🟠 P1 – Fix immediately after invariant test

⸻

B. Can’t Delete Pending Actions
Blocking, annoying, but reversible.

Status:
🟠 P1 – Same batch as A

These two belong together because they touch the Actions system.

⸻

🟡 TRUE P2 (Correctness Adjacent, Not Blocking)

C. Contact Update via AI Assistant Not Working
“Updated Jen Howell’s address, card didn’t change”

This is bad, but now clearly scoped:
	•	The interaction + signal still exist
	•	The user can manually fix the contact
	•	Trust is dented, not shattered

Status:
🟡 P2 – Fix after Actions are reliable

⸻

D. Wrong Dates in Weekly Review
Classic timezone/display bug.

Annoying, credibility-eroding, but:
	•	No data loss
	•	No workflow break

Status:
🟡 P2 – Batch with other display bugs

⸻

E. AI Cost Not Updating Immediately
Pure analytics.

Now that correctness is solid:
	•	This is a visibility issue only

Status:
🟡 P2/P3 – Low urgency

⸻

🟢 TRUE P3 (Features, Not Bugs)

These were never bugs — they were future product surface area.
	•	AI-assisted note rewriting
	•	GTD Someday/Maybe
	•	Adjustable chat window
	•	Editable tasks with audit trail

Status:
🟢 Explicitly NOT NOW

⸻

3️⃣ CORRECT EXECUTION ORDER (THIS MATTERS)

Here is the only sane sequence from here:

⸻

✅ STEP 0 — Lock the Invariant (If Not Done)

One automated test:
	•	Log interaction
	•	Assert signal exists

This is your safety net.

⸻

🔧 STEP 1 — Actions Reliability (P1 Batch)

Do these together:
	1.	Fix signal → action creation
	2.	Fix Actions list visibility
	3.	Fix delete pending action

Why together?
	•	Same mental context
	•	Same data model
	•	Same UI surface

Goal:

When a user decides, they see and can manage the outcome.

⸻

🔧 STEP 2 — AI Updates & Weekly Review (P2 Batch)
	1.	Contact updates via AI
	2.	Weekly review date correctness
	3.	Any remaining cache invalidation issues

These are about confidence, not flow.

⸻

🔧 STEP 3 — Analytics Hygiene (Optional)
	•	AI cost real-time vs daily clarity
	•	Admin dashboard polish

Only do this once:
	•	You’re demoing
	•	Or charging

⸻

4️⃣ WHAT NOT TO DO (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do not:
	•	Add new AI features
	•	Add GTD complexity
	•	Add new modes
	•	Optimize cost prematurely
	•	Improve UI aesthetics

Why?

You just crossed the hardest threshold: truth.
Now you stabilize execution, not expand scope.

⸻

🧠 MENTAL MODEL GOING FORWARD

You should now think in layers:
	1.	Invariant layer (done)
	2.	Execution layer (Actions, drafts, deletes)
	3.	Presentation layer (dates, UI feedback)
	4.	Expansion layer (features)

Never mix layers again.

⸻

FINAL ANSWER (CRISP)
	•	The remaining bugs still matter
	•	None are P0 anymore
	•	The next correct move is:
Fix the Actions system end-to-end

If you want, next I can:
	•	Produce a P1 Actions System task list
	•	Or help you design a minimal demo script now that Phase 1 is real

Say which.
