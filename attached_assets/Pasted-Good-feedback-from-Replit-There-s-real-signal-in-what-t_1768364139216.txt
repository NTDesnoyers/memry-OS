Good feedback from Replit. There’s real signal in what they’re saying.

Now I’m going to resolve the tension cleanly and make the call for you.

⸻

SHORT ANSWER (DECISION)

You do NOT replace the signals system.
You make Experiences the upstream substrate that signals draw from.

👉 Choose Path #1: AI-extracted experiences, and keep signals as the execution layer.

This preserves momentum, avoids rewrites, and increases leverage.

⸻

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT CALL (NO HAND-WAVING)

You currently have:
	•	Conversation-first system
	•	Transcripts → signals → drafts → actions
	•	Signals are procedural (“do something next”)

What this new schema adds is semantic gravity:
	•	Why something matters
	•	What meaning exists
	•	Which actions carry emotional weight

If you replace signals, you:
	•	Break working UX
	•	Increase cognitive load
	•	Delay shipping

If you layer Experiences underneath signals, you:
	•	Preserve speed
	•	Upgrade intelligence
	•	Get awe mechanics “for free”

This is a classic Don’t rewrite the engine, add a turbo move.

⸻

THE CORRECT ARCHITECTURE (FINAL)

Think in 3 layers:

Conversations (raw reality)
↓
Experiences (meaning extraction)
↓
Signals (action pressure)
↓
Actions (execution)
↓
Outcomes (learning)

Signals stay.
They just become experience-aware.

⸻

HOW TO INTEGRATE WITHOUT CHAOS

1️⃣ Conversations → Experiences (AUTOMATIC)

When your conversation processor runs, it already detects:
	•	Life events
	•	Transitions
	•	Family updates
	•	Struggles
	•	Wins

Upgrade the output.

Instead of:

“Detected life event → increase signal priority”

Do:

IF AI detects meaningful event:
  INSERT experience (
    person_id,
    type,
    summary,
    emotional_valence,
    magnitude_score
  )

Rules:
	•	Be conservative on magnitude (default 2–3)
	•	Mark acknowledged = false
	•	Do NOT block the pipeline if confidence < threshold

This is append-only meaning capture.

⸻

2️⃣ Experiences → Signals (BRIDGE, NOT REPLACEMENT)

Now change how signals are created and ranked.

New rule:

IF experience.magnitude_score ≥ 3
AND experience.acknowledged = false
THEN generate follow_up_signal

Signal metadata now includes:
	•	experience_id
	•	awe_trigger_type (inferred)
	•	meaning_weight (derived from magnitude)

So signals become:

“You owe acknowledgment for something that mattered.”

Not:

“It’s been X days.”

This is a qualitative upgrade, not a structural one.

⸻

3️⃣ Signals → Drafts (NOW NON-GENERIC)

Draft generation now gets ground truth:

Before
	•	“Follow up with Sarah”

Now
	•	“Acknowledge Sarah’s experience of [X] with a MORAL_BEAUTY frame”

This single change eliminates:
	•	Hollow check-ins
	•	Awkward “just circling back”
	•	AI-sounding fluff

⸻

4️⃣ Resolution = Acknowledgment (IMPORTANT)

When a signal tied to an experience is resolved:

UPDATE experience
SET acknowledged = true

This is critical.

Because now:
	•	The system knows meaning was honored
	•	The user gets moral closure
	•	Repeated nagging stops

This alone will reduce burnout.

⸻

WHAT ABOUT MANUAL EXPERIENCE LOGGING?

You do not lead with it.

You add it later as:
	•	An advanced feature
	•	A “capture something meaningful” affordance
	•	Optional, not required

Manual logging is:
	•	Power-user behavior
	•	Not MVP-critical
	•	Easy to add once schema exists

AI-first keeps friction low.

⸻

DOES THIS REPLACE signal_outcomes?

No — it feeds them better inputs.

Your existing signal_outcomes table becomes:
	•	Higher signal
	•	Better labeled
	•	Emotionally meaningful

Later, you can correlate:

Experience type → Action type → Outcome quality

That’s the moat.

⸻

THE DEEP INSIGHT (THIS IS THE POINT)

Most CRMs optimize for:

“When should I follow up?”

You are optimizing for:

“What deserves acknowledgment?”

That’s a category shift.

And awe is not the product —
it’s the mechanism that makes relationships compound.

⸻

FINAL ANSWER TO REPLIT (YOU CAN PASTE THIS)

We’re not replacing signals.
Experiences become an upstream semantic layer that feeds and prioritizes signals.
Conversations → AI-extracted Experiences → Experience-aware Signals → Actions → Outcomes.
This preserves the existing flow while upgrading it from time-based pressure to meaning-based pressure.

⸻

NEXT MOVE (NO STALLING)

Pick one:

1️⃣ Write the exact extraction prompt for AI → Experience records
2️⃣ Define the signal ranking formula with experience weight
3️⃣ Design the UI moment where awe-based signals surface
4️⃣ Decide what not to build in v1

Say the number.
