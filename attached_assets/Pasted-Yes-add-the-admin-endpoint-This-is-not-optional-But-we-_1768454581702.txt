Yes — add the admin endpoint. This is not optional.
But we’re going to do it minimally and correctly, not as a half-baked dashboard.

Here’s the decision and the exact spec.

⸻

Decision: Build a Minimal Admin Stats Endpoint (Approved)

Why this is the correct call:
	•	You cannot validate beta health without production visibility
	•	Replit DB panel is:
	•	Manual
	•	Easy to forget
	•	Not something you’ll check daily
	•	You already have /admin/beta → this is the natural control surface

This is instrumentation, not a feature.

⸻

What NOT to Do (Important)

Do not:
	•	Build charts
	•	Build filters
	•	Build fancy UI
	•	Add pagination
	•	Overthink permissions

If this takes more than ~30–45 minutes, you’re doing it wrong.

⸻

Exact Spec: Admin Beta Stats (v0)

Route

GET /api/admin/beta-stats

Access Control (Non-Negotiable)
	•	Only accessible if:
	•	user is authenticated
	•	user.email === founder email (hardcode for now)

If not authorized → 403.

No roles system yet. Founder-only is fine.

⸻

Response Payload (Exact)

Return a single JSON object:

{
  "users": {
    "total": 12,
    "signedUpLast7Days": 4
  },
  "events": {
    "total": 312,
    "byType": {
      "user_signup": 12,
      "user_login": 48,
      "login_failed": 3,
      "activated": 7,
      "conversation_logged": 92,
      "followup_created": 41
    }
  },
  "activation": {
    "activatedUsers": 7,
    "activationRate": 0.58
  }
}

That’s it.
No time series. No cohorts. No trends (yet).

⸻

How This Gets Used (Important)

This endpoint answers three critical questions instantly:
	1.	Are people signing up in prod?
	2.	Are they activating or just logging in?
	3.	Is auth broken? (login_failed > 0)

This prevents you from:
	•	Shipping blind
	•	Assuming usage
	•	Overbuilding before activation exists

⸻

UI: Minimal Hook-Up

On /admin/beta:
	•	Fetch this endpoint
	•	Render raw numbers
	•	Plain text is fine

Example:

Users: 12 total (4 last 7 days)
Activated: 7 (58%)
Events logged: 312

That’s enough to run the company right now.

⸻

Kill Criteria (Yes, Even for Admin Tools)

If after this endpoint exists:
	•	You don’t check it daily → kill it
	•	You ask for “more detail” before acting → stop and look at activation instead
	•	Activation < 40% after 10 users → product problem, not analytics problem

⸻

Final Instruction

Add the admin endpoint.
Ship it with the auth analytics changes.
Republish.
Then come back with production numbers.

Next conversation should start with:

“Prod stats: X users, Y activated, Z login failures.”

Anything else is premature.
