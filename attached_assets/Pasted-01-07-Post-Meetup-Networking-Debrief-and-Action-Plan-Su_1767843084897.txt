Contact Summaries and Opportunities
Nathan Desnoyers detailed his interactions with several individuals, identifying their backgrounds, real estate activities, and potential avenues for future business.
   Matt Smalley: A firefighter who works in Springfield and commutes from his home in Harrisonburg. He owns a rental property in Stafford and is identified as a potential source for off-market deals. He is described as a tall man with glasses and a thick mustache.
   Matt Ingram: A previous acquaintance who lives in D.C. and is a paraglider. He recently purchased an Airbnb in Bailey, Colorado, for $670,000 with a 10% down payment, and enjoyed performing the renovation work himself. Matt is active in private money lending using his 401(k) and offers 100% financing for flips. He expressed a willingness to pay points for borrower referrals, presenting a clear business opportunity.
   Shannon Erickson: A house hacker residing in Hyattsville, Maryland, who also owns a property in the Pleasant Valley area of D.C.
   Casey Ico: An investor who Nathan had met previously at a meetup and also knew through bowling. Casey had interviewed Nathan while shopping for a house hack but ultimately purchased a property in Springfield with another agent. His current house-hacking strategy is performing well, utilizing a rent-by-the-room model. He has a unique utility-sharing arrangement where tenants are charged for any utility costs that exceed the historical average by 20%.
   Daniel Dang: An attendee who will facilitate an introduction to a contact named Manny. Manny works in real estate and technology, and Daniel believes this could be a valuable connection for Nathan.
   Pete Seiler: A contact Nathan was happy to reconnect with. Pete got engaged in November and is planning a wedding for May.
