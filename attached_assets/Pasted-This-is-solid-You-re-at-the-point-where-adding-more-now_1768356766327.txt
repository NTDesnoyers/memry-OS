This is solid. You’re at the point where **adding more now risks slowing learning**, so the job is to **separate “must-lock now” from “explicitly defer.”**

I’ll answer each, then give you a **clear GO / NO-GO**.

---

## Quick verdict first

👉 **Yes, you’re ready to build. Proceed.**

But only after locking **exactly two more MVP clarifications** and explicitly deferring the rest.

---

## Item-by-item judgment

### 1️⃣ Third-party mentions

**Already covered. No extra work needed.**

Your current rule:

> one signal per person mentioned

✔ Correct
✔ Elegant
✔ Scales

Do **not** add special casing like “primary vs secondary person.”
Let ranking handle importance.

**Status:** ✅ MVP-ready, no changes.

---

### 2️⃣ Outcome tracking (skipped → missed opportunity)

This is **insightful**, but **NOT MVP-critical**.

Why:

* It requires retroactive attribution logic
* It risks false positives (“they texted me” ≠ missed opportunity)
* It doesn’t change *immediate behavior*

What *is* MVP-worthy:

* Track this passively in data
* Do NOT surface it yet

**V2 concept (park it explicitly):**

> “Signals skipped that later resulted in inbound contact within X days”

That’s gold later for:

* Trust-building
* Coaching insights
* “Your instincts are improving” feedback

**Status:** 🚫 Defer to V2 (but log the data quietly).

---

### 3️⃣ Life events in reasoning

**This absolutely matters — and it’s already aligned.**

This is not a new feature.
This is **copy discipline**.

The reasoning text is doing critical work:

* Explains *why* the signal exists
* Trains sales judgment
* Builds trust in the AI

**MVP requirement (lock this in):**
When a life event is detected, it MUST appear in the reasoning line.

Example:

> “New job mentioned → high-priority follow-up”

No UI complexity.
Just deterministic explanation.

**Status:** ✅ MVP-required.

---

### 4️⃣ Text draft formatting

Good to define now, but keep it **rule-based and simple**.

You don’t need personalization sophistication yet — just **mode correctness**.

**MVP text rules (lock):**

* 1–3 sentences
* Casual tone
* No subject
* No signature
* First name greeting optional
* Ends with a soft CTA (“wanted to check in”, “thought I’d reach out”)

Emails can be looser later.
Texts must feel human immediately.

**Status:** ✅ MVP-required (simple heuristic, not AI magic).

---

### 5️⃣ Playbooks (user-editable rules)

This is the **most dangerous thing to add early**.

Why:

* Adds config overhead
* Encourages tinkering over usage
* Masks whether defaults are good

Playbooks are **power-user leverage**, not MVP learning.

Correct sequencing:

* You define defaults
* Observe behavior
* THEN expose customization

**Status:** 🚫 Explicitly V2. Do NOT sneak this in.

---

## The only two things to explicitly add before building

If you do **nothing else**, lock these:

### 🔒 Lock #1: Reasoning copy standard

Every signal reasoning must include:

* Trigger (call / meeting / mention)
* Contact segment
* Life event if present

This is not cosmetic — it’s *training the user*.

---

### 🔒 Lock #2: Outcome tracking definition (internal only)

Even if not surfaced, define:

* Success = next interaction within 14 days
* Neutral = no interaction
* Missed opportunity = inbound after skip (logged, hidden)

This ensures:

* Clean analytics later
* No schema changes midstream

---

## Everything else is correctly deferred

You’ve done the hard part:
You resisted turning this into a feature buffet.

Right now this is:

* Focused
* Behavior-shaping
* Fast to test
* Easy to explain

Which is exactly what you want.

---

## Final instruction

**Yes — proceed with build.**
Do not add:

* Playbooks
* Skip reasons
* Push notifications
* Retroactive guilt metrics

Ship this. Watch real users.
Then we’ll sharpen based on **observed behavior**, not hypotheticals.

When it’s built, bring me:

* First user confusion
* First friction point
* First “oh shit that felt good” moment

That’s where V2 earns its place.
