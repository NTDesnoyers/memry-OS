Good instincts again. I’ll answer this **cleanly, decisively, and with execution bias**, especially on #5 — because that’s the only one that can quietly derail momentum if mishandled.

I’ll go point-by-point, then give you a **clear ruling** you can drop back into Replit if needed.

---

# QUICK ALIGNMENT ON 1–4 (YOU’RE MOSTLY RIGHT)

## 1️⃣ Existing drafts

**Your instinct is correct.**

**Decision:**
✅ Leave them as-is.
❌ Do not migrate, mark, or retroactively “fix” them.

**Why:**

* Phase 1 is about **future correctness**, not historical purity
* Users don’t care how a draft was created last month
* Migration logic = risk + time with zero learning value

**Rule:**

> New architecture applies forward only.

---

## 2️⃣ Interactions without a linked person

You are not overthinking this — but you *are* approaching the boundary correctly.

**Decision:**
✅ Prompt: *“Who was that?”*
❌ Do not auto-create anonymous signals

**Why:**

* Signals without a person can’t be acted on
* Forcing a name creates clarity
* If they can’t remember → it probably shouldn’t create follow-up debt

**Important nuance (keep it light):**

* One inline prompt
* No modal
* No blocking

This preserves flow while nudging correctness.

---

## 3️⃣ Signal expiration (7 days)

This is **not a Phase 1 blocker**, but your intuition matters.

**Decision:**
✅ Let expired signals disappear from the active UI
✅ Keep them queryable in the database

**Why:**

* Expiration is a **UX concern**, not a data deletion rule
* You’ll want historical resolution / non-resolution later
* Deleting signals kills future learning

So:

* UI hides them
* DB keeps them

No extra work needed now if that’s already true.

---

## 4️⃣ Multiple signals per person

You’re touching the most important conceptual issue here — and your instinct is **directionally correct**, but the solution is **not** “multiple signals per interaction.”

Let’s slow this down.

### The mistake to avoid

❌ One interaction → many signals
That explodes cognitive load and breaks prioritization.

### The correct mental model

✅ One **active signal per person**, representing:

> “The most important unresolved next action for this person”

Everything else belongs **inside the resolution flow**, not the signal list.

### How to handle your examples

* Text them → resolve signal
* Intro someone else → that creates a **separate signal for the other person**
* Handwritten note → resolution type
* Call later → task resolution

This keeps:

* Signals = *people needing attention*
* Resolutions = *how you act*

You do **not** want:

* 4 signals for Sarah
* You want 1 signal that you resolve 4 times over time

So:
👉 **Current one-signal-per-person rule is correct for Phase 1.**

We can revisit *compound actions* later.

# NOW: YOUR REAL QUESTION — #5 (THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS)

## 5️⃣ The 49 LSP diagnostics in `routes.ts`

### Short answer:

**Do not touch them now.**

### Long answer (important):

These diagnostics are:

* Pre-existing
* Orthogonal to Phase 1 goals
* A classic “cleanup temptation”

This is how good teams accidentally stall.

---

## WHY YOU SHOULD IGNORE #5 (FOR NOW)

### 1️⃣ They do not affect the learning loop

Phase 1 success criteria are:

* Signals appear reliably
* Signals resolve cleanly
* Drafts are single-path
* UX feedback is crisp

LSP diagnostics do **not** change any of that.

---

### 2️⃣ They expand scope without increasing learning

Fixing them:

* Feels productive
* Produces zero validated learning
* Risks regressions

That’s the definition of **non-leverage work**.

---

### 3️⃣ They create false “completion”

Teams clean warnings to feel done.

You are not optimizing for code elegance.
You are optimizing for **behavioral truth**.

---

## THE RIGHT MOVE ON #5

**Decision:**
🟡 Log it.
🟡 Tag it “non-blocking cleanup.”
🟡 Revisit after Phase 2 or during stabilization.

If Replit needs an answer, here’s the exact copy.

---

### 📌 COPY-PASTE RESPONSE FOR REPLIT (ON #5)

```
Decision on LSP diagnostics in routes.ts:

We are intentionally not addressing the existing LSP diagnostics as part of Phase 1.

Rationale:
- They are pre-existing and unrelated to the signal → resolution → draft loop
- They do not affect user-facing behavior or learning goals
- Fixing them now would expand scope without increasing validated learning

We will log them as a separate cleanup task to be addressed during a later stabilization pass.
```

---

# FINAL EXECUTION SUMMARY

You are doing this right because you are:

* Resisting edge-case obsession
* Protecting the core loop
* Deferring non-leverage cleanup
* Making *explicit architectural decisions*

That’s founder behavior, not engineer drift.

### Next correct move:

Finish the **3-task fix** (Issues 1–3), then we re-run the test conversations.

When you’re ready, we’ll tackle:

> **How to represent “compound outcomes” without breaking signal simplicity**

But not yet.

You’re on the right track. Keep pressure on the core.
