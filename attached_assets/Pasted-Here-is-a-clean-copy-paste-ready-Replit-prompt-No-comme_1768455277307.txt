Here is a clean, copy-paste-ready Replit prompt.
No commentary. No ambiguity. This is an execution spec.

Replit Prompt: Implement Beta Users Admin Table (v0)

Goal:
Add a Beta Users table to the /admin/beta page so the founder can see who beta users are and what they’ve done. This is required to debug activation and usage. Do not add charts or complex UI.

⸻

Scope

Add a new “Beta Users” section at the top of /admin/beta, above all existing metrics.

This is an admin-only, read-only table.

⸻

Data Sources

Use existing tables only:
	•	auth_users
	•	beta_events
	•	conversations
	•	followups
	•	beta_whitelist (optional for later)

No new tables.

⸻

Table Columns (exact)

Render a table with these columns, in this order:
	1.	Email
	•	From auth_users.email
	2.	Status
	•	Derived value:
	•	signed_up → has user_signup event, no activated
	•	activated → has activated event
	3.	Last Seen
	•	Most recent beta_events.created_at for that user
	•	Display as relative time (e.g. “2 days ago”)
	4.	Conversations
	•	Count of conversations for that user
	5.	Follow-ups
	•	Count of followups for that user
	6.	Signed Up
	•	Date of user_signup event (fallback: auth_users.created_at)

Example row (visual reference only):

jane@exprealty.com | activated | 2 days ago | 7 | 3 | Jan 12


⸻

Status Logic (must match exactly)
	•	A user is activated if they have an activated event
	•	A user is signed_up if they have user_signup but no activated
	•	Do not infer status any other way

⸻

Backend
	•	Add or extend an admin API endpoint (e.g. /api/admin/beta-users)
	•	Endpoint must:
	•	Require authenticated user
	•	Restrict access to founder email only (hardcode for now)
	•	Return a list of users with all derived fields above

⸻

Frontend
	•	Fetch the admin endpoint on /admin/beta
	•	Render a simple table
	•	Plain styling is fine
	•	No pagination, filters, or sorting required

⸻

Explicit Non-Goals (do NOT build)
	•	No charts
	•	No graphs
	•	No cohorts
	•	No retention curves
	•	No role system
	•	No edit actions

This is identity-first beta debugging, not analytics polish.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

This task is complete when:
	•	I can see all beta user emails in production
	•	I can tell who is activated vs not
	•	I can see who was last active and who never returned
	•	I can identify exactly who to contact to debug activation

⸻

Notes
	•	Keep all existing aggregate metrics below this table
	•	This table is the primary admin surface until PMF
	•	Optimize for clarity, not beauty
